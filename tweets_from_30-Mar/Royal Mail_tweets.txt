hey, @RoyalMail if yr postman cant be bothered filling out the missed delivery card am I just supposed to guess where my parcel is?!
@RoyalMail also had two parcels gone missing? Delivered but not found?
@RoyalMail my mail isn't being put through our letter box. Left outside to get wet or thrown on porch floor.
@RoyalMail @PostOffice ah didn't realise. Thank you :)
@RoyalMail how long does it take for a first class parcel to get after I sent it on Tuesday????
@RoyalMail Today. I was in. My bell works fine. This is the 2nd time it's happened
@RoyalMail and what kind of delay can i expect??
@YodelOnline Parcel bumped and late by two days, then today I'm 65th in the delivery queue, just pop my parcel in @RoyalMail #defeated
@RoyalMail my fault and the delays are going to cost me
@RoyalMail i have paid for this service so thats its tracked and gets there in time. Is there any compensation i can claim as this was not..
Joke of a service @RoyalMail 2nd time this month an item has had to go back to the sender as your redelivery rules are so strict :( #angry
Good old @RoyalMail yet again. RM tracking says nobody available at reception desk which is always manned and took item back.Awful service.
@RoyalMail I've tried calling the Lichfield office to complain. Some one answer the phone! Terrible service! https://t.co/AWx30RuvIX
