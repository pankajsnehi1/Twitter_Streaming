@wolvesbradders @SkyUK I have been off this week so did it ok the morning it was fine, evening have been an issue b4
@mja1980 @SkyUK  Yeah, as and when the useless buggers answer the phone I will do :-)

@tonbaberdeen @SkyUK good man get it cancelled!
Nope @Thorpey85 no reply! Another phone call beckons.... @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam
@SkyUK Sky Chat is pointless - they tell you to use the phone! Then you phone and they can't help you - no reason for a 20 day delay
@SkyUK So I join sky, £90 per month on SkyQ and you can't install the phone line or fibre for another 20 days - the others can though
@SkyUK patiently waiting for a reply
@SkyUK desidero essere contattato urgentemente grazie

2nd time in the space of a month with no internet... no help through customer service, not even willing to send out an engineer 😡 @SkyUK
Although whoever is in charge of organising the ep guides on @SkyUK has done a poor job - all the ones I've seen are completely wrong!
@MoneySavingExp been having a nightmare moving my phone and broadband from @BTCare to @SkyUK -any advice?
@DHoldsworth91 @SkyUK They cannot do that.. report them!!
Broadband keeps dropping as it gets closer to weekend.. again 🙄 Cheers for that @SkyUK Another family film night potentially ruined.
What an utter shambles @SkyUK is.  Really tempted just to cancel it. 😡
@virginmedia 2.Only just received this despite your twitter profile stating help available until 10pm @SkyUK were able to respond in minutes
@SkyUK I can see why people leave you for other providers now and also your handlers didn't even appear to really give a shit
So @SkyUK have charged me for £28 for calls I have made from a landline. I don't even have a home phone so work that one out 😡 #NotHappy
@SkyUK I hear you give customers wifi boosters 👀
yet AGAIN being messed around by @SkyUK I am yet to meet someone with a positive experience of this company. Beyond frustrating.
If you like a big ole bit of epic telly you might just be into this. Downton creators on @SkyUK Sooooooon!  https://t.co/DSQDIlYzkh
@SkyUK bit pricey £33 for 1gb with iphone7 id mobile do that for £20pm including minutes and texts.
Hey @SkyNews @SkyUK - Maybe you should focus on REAL things, instead of made up propaganda "law" stories. God knows… https://t.co/WI16ZSwQfS
@SkyUK Shout out to Shane in the Broadband 🇮🇪 contact centre, fantastic service, a true hero in a headset! #greatservice, #efficient, #hero
@SkyUK when will ep 1 of the flash etc be back on catch up season 3 . Thanks
@SkyUK 3 days I've been trying to cancel my wifi (don't worry I still have sky where I'm moving too) text, live chat, Facebook. Guess what ?
Who's got faster broadband, @SkyUK Or @virginmedia or even @TalkTalk ?
@SkyUK why doesn't your so called help reply to anything.? Been three days!!!!!
@SkyUK hope the service works better than the site 😉
Besides @SkyUK who can I get @SkySportsF1 from? @EE?  @bt_uk?  @virginmedia (doesn't work in my area I don't think) @TalkTalk?
Pls no one ever move to @SkyUK i think the poor children in Africa have a better chance of making a better sky q box that doesn't crash 24/7
@SkyUk absolutely awful customer service on your online chat today!
@SkyUK @SonyElectronics. No answer no help. This is not good enough.
@virginmedia It's a website with a simple game on. It works at uni and on my friend's @SkyUK internet connection.

New @SkyUK customers get a free Sky Q box, existing customers have to pay £199! I can see my subscription getting canceled @SkyHelpTeam
@SkyUK  my internet is working at home! Can you please do something about it! I'm sick of complaining!
Não assistam @SkyUK de madrugada porque não passa nada que preste! 😒
@SkyUK sounds interesting could do with some more info
@virginmedia so my bill go up each month yet new customers get this great deal?? Hello @SkyUK what can you offer? https://t.co/FDQLklygm0
@SkyUK followed a link to cancel my subscription, too expensive, was offered 10% off for 12 months to stay, my a/c hasn't been amended-WHY?
Switch from @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam because of poor customer service, waiting for my refund for the last month, and I get charged £30! WTF?
@SkyUK your broadband is shocking !!! Defiantly starting to shop around for a better service !!!!
I like the thought of swapping phones every 12 months but damn that's expensive @SkyUK https://t.co/kgbVwW2tYG
@UnitedStandMUFC big companies @bt_uk  and @SkyUK should stop ripping people off. And BT should have left football alone. They've ruined it!
@SkyUK how do I complain about the fact you won't let me a log a complaint? Worst service of all the suppliers I 'choose' to buy from. #poor
@SkyUK ..FAIRPLAY TO SKY..WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS....4 BLOODY WEEKS WAITING FOR A PHONE LINE AND BROADBAND...!!!!!!! WHATS GOING ON.....
@SkyUK how am I suppose to start a chat...

@SkyUK we were promised a new remote a month ago. Still waiting and more of the buttons on the old one have packed in.
@SkyUK ....and thanks for calling me back about my lack of broadband today as you said you would......still waiting !
@StevoCook @SkyUK for the 100th time today 😩😩😩
I've had to buy 3gb of more data this month because my shitty wifi keeps dropping on my phone 😡 @SkyUK sort it out.

@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam we have given you the correct notice to cancel our TV package so please stop calling &amp; texting, we are not staying
@SkyUK can you explain why my bill has gone up from £23,99 to £32,99?
@virginmedia @SkyUK @bt_uk @VodafoneUK 
I would like to know if you provide fibre optic to my local area?NW3. #TimeToChange #needanewservice
@DaveDavetron @SkyUK @NOWTVSport Yeah I know, but I need to be at the end of a contract to make that wiggle room 😂😂😂
@RobsonBen @SkyUK @NOWTVSport good offer and there is always wiggle room at end of contract 😄
@DaveDavetron @SkyUK Well, for the sake of £30+ a month for @NOWTVSport I may as well get the full Sky package (1/2 price offer ATM)
I think it's easier to break up with an overly clingy boyfriend, than leave @SkyUK . Going blue in the face saying the same thing over 🙄
@RobsonBen @SkyUK nowtv ? If so I think they do same.
@DaveDavetron I don't have @SkyUK to start with 😂😂😂 (Well, I do have Sky Fibre)

What do I do if my download speed has never reached the 4mbps quoted by @SkyUK ? Surely I should get the minimum speed I was quoted?
Could scream at my @SkyUK broadband. Having to go use my mum's wifi to do an online course. Can't wait for my contract to end 😕

@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK - When will Sky Go streaming be fixed? Only a few shows can be streamed and most say not available...
It annoys me companies like @SkyUK @bt_uk Mobile Providers etc have the biggest offers for new members and not for long term customers.
@SkyUK customer of 20 years you get nothing, but a new customer gets a plasma , half price subscription &amp; a BBQ round Stephen van Rooyens
@nadiasawalha @SkyUK Hope you all feel better soon sending lots of hugs xx
@SkyUK @SonyElectronics so whos fault is it when i get a blue screen not connected via hdmi? been getting this all the time #notgoodenough
ALÔ @skybrasil @SkyUK  contratei com SBT,  quero desconto na mensalidade então.
Playing on mobile data because my internet provider @SkyUK decides to drop on me tonight. Thank you Sky.
@SkyUK You set up a new router in our house a week ago. We're paying for 42mbps download speeds, and we're getting 0.7mbps. What?!?! :S
@AmeRoSharky @JackDFielder @EE I moved from @SkyUK recently I had no issues with them other than cost. I guess it's backfiring now!
Infelizmente no momento estou sem @SkyUK e @NetflixBrasil , Então oque nos resta ?! Ele, o maravilhoso e incrível @YouTube ! ❤
What is wrong with @SkyUK broadband again?! @SkyHelpTeam
