@CocaCola_GB Why is that foods that are labeled organic do not have High Fructose Corn Syrup?
@CocaCola_GB Whatever the Corn Refiners Association told you is a complete and utter lie. We as consumers have a right to know.
@CocaCola_GB then explain what HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) is or what Corn Sugar is. Why is not available in Retail Stores then?
We are open. Thank you to everyone who made it possible @SPARSW @CountryChoiceUK @CocaCola_GB to name a few
