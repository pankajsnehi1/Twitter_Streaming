@Tesco hi Jordan, that contradicts what your colleague Mat told me above... It also makes no sense... May I ask why to both questions pls?

@Tesco although tbh the date/time is irrelevant. The store is 24 hr, &amp; food safety/quality should be upheld at all times.

@Terri_White @Tesco the Armley, Leeds in West Yorkshire one regularly stinks too. It's awful in there. Rubbish selection too.
@juliecameron961 @Tesco good luck in your new role!!
@Tesco you should the chocolate ones looked good too üòä
@Tesco why is there now a charge for click and collect?! Shopping with a baby, packing bags and loading the car is tough going.

Great product placement at Sheffield's Saville Street @Tesco by @GuySalmonJLR  and @LandRover. https://t.co/8ozbnlAxX5
@Tesco just opened this morning and it's off! This continually happens :( https://t.co/Rw1rv17e5a
@GlobalFishWatch @WholeFoods excellent news, well done! Now we just need the other #supermarkets to catch up! @GPUKoceans @Tesco @Morrisons
@Tesco these pictures sort of contradict how effective the cleaning is...
@Tesco Can someone in Tesco explain to me why are you charging for click and collect? Are you wanting your customers to switch to Sainsbury
@Tesco delivery driver has been and gone and still no text received

@Tesco as a household we spend ¬£1000s in your stores each year. Should we stop? Pls consider what your ad spend fun‚Ä¶ https://t.co/rjr3Rpl3ds
@ComplainingCow @Tesco üëçand I got to see you before I left. Perfect timing lol
@Tesco I will inform the staff when I next visit the store. But I have no doubt it will have little impact. Thanks for your reply.
@Tesco when will I find out the time of my flex delivery slot? Delivery is scheduled for 7-11am this morning
@Tesco Sorry James - didn't get the reg no, but the pic was taken @ 15:36 on broomhill road in cove, Hamps. Hopefully that's enough info
@sainsburys ok, thanks. I guess we will have to continue doing a top-up shop at @Tesco Guildford for the items you don't stock
Was wondering, does @PizzaExpress metrocentre still take the @Tesco Clubcard vouchers?
pure love @Tesco x https://t.co/t3OozKWJV3
@CoolAntiZionist @Paparazzi_daz @Tesco 
They did well.
@sarahred11 @Tesco what the heck?Happy Mothers Day to your mum xxx
@Tesco And thus im sharing with others so they don't waste a tenner on meat that's so poor it seems to go off as the clock strikes midnight!
@Tesco I didn't ask for guarantee, jst commenting that meat being entirely ROTTEN cos opened 10hrs after date stamp is ridiculous &amp; unusual
@Tesco Very disappointing &amp; surprisingly poor. Ovay. A Morrisons steak pie rescued our Sat eve dinner thankfully!
@Tesco Hi, that's a quick response! I isn't keep the receipt but yep, the expiration date was just yest &amp; it's been in the fridge whole time

@CoolAntiZionist @Paparazzi_daz @Tesco 
I thought maybe an activist had put up the sign...
Important people get to know, by whatever means
@CoolAntiZionist @Paparazzi_daz @Tesco 
Who put up the sign? 
Tesco? At least the buyers are aware of where goods coming from.
@Tesco also what about those that are parked illegally? You never see a parking attendant issuing fines to them??
@Tesco thanks, I am aware of this however the spaces are filled with BWFC fans &amp; not Tesco custs. This is blatant ask any Horwich resident!
@StopFundingHate @Tesco @LBC @Independent @Telegraph #fakenews _ This is a story from 2008, but your inaccurate tweet is 2 days old.
@boxnationtv Don't make me get on the bike lads.. That @Tesco 24 hour garage is looking good

@Tesco @asda here's hoping the old issues that made me switch after 20yrs in the first place have been resolved #fingerscrossed#farwellTesco
@Tesco @asda well after a great year with Tesco, click and collect just done with Asda. # I'm back #notpayingtescoforclickandcollect
@Tesco it's the Tesco Southwark store, I tweeted at you guys before a week ago and it's the same situation, no stock in the back to restock.
@Tesco off I go back to Asda where they don't try to squeeze loyal &amp; regular customers for every last penny #notpayingforclickandcollect
