@Morrisons my experience would disagree with your comment. As you can see from this picture. It's not a joke. #lettoysbetoys

@brettsanders1 @Morrisons I'm fuming fleecey. My cats are hungry and I have no beer.
@GeoffWilkinson_ @Morrisons they done it to annoy you
@Morrisons and why is it closed now so some mong serves me from a window. It's always been open to walk in until you cretins bought it.
@Morrisons I ask for cat BISCUIT and get jellied chunks, ask for BAGUETTE, I get a loaf of brown bread. Outrage. I'm furious.
Oi @Morrisons why have you taken over my local garage and staffed it with complete morons who literally don't speak a word of English.
