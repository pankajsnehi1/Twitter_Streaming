@penholi @BarclaysUK it's really hard for me to get to the bank at the best of times but will be even harder now.Will have to go to Hatfield
@penholi @BarclaysUK Agreed. It's always so busy. Only going to make the town centre one worse. Such a bad move
@hello_easytiger @BarclaysUK Glad things are all taken care of!
Barclays just informed me some unscrupulous characters had gone on a spending spree with my card details! All safeâ€¦ https://t.co/713ueqWuYc
@KatieMorley_ @BarclaysUK Switch to First Direct bank!
@BarclaysUK why can't in box you ?
Getting a @BarclaysUK debit card set up for Apple Pay is surprisingly convoluted. Not your typical smooth Apple experience.
@BarclaysUK Hello, who can I speak to about raising money for a charity, when completing an event?
@Ry5ter @BarclaysUK I think it's if you're a new customer, it seems existing ones can open one online ðŸ˜´
@htimsnad @BarclaysUK It's 2017, do you need to actually speak to somebidy to open an ISA still?
@ES_Entrepreneur @BarclaysUK The app has become a joke - no more Barclaycard facilities. They used to be so good for customer services!
Pretty disappointing, trying to open an ISA with @BarclaysUK and they don't offer appointments after work or at weekends? ðŸ™„
@KatieMorley_ @BarclaysUK I also am a bit irritated that the tool claiming to be 24/7 is 'closest' right now... https://t.co/wqb99rZjqX
Not good @BarclaysUK #Kingsheath #disappointing https://t.co/0kTh972jci
@BarclaysUK my father in law wants to pay his bill and you refuse to send one because he doesn't have the confidence to talk on the phone ðŸ˜¡

@KatieMorley_ @BarclaysUK First Direct. Only way to go.
Been a @BarclaysUK customer my entire life but now am quitting. For 2nd time in a week I'm blocked from my bank AND credit card. Just awful.
@BarclaysUKHelp @BarclaysUK I can not find out if an international currency payment has gone because your support is not there? pathetic

2017 and the @BarclaysUK website still can't manage a bug free online account app. 30 mins and a customer lost!
The most sensible idea in years for the Army Reserves - well done @BarclaysUK https://t.co/YWb7FCGN1S via @MailOnline
@BarclaysUK main reason I chose to bank with Barclays was the convenience of bank location. Terrible
Really disappointed to hear @BarclaysUK are closing their Marshalswick branch. How am I supposed to have time to get to bank now?! ðŸ˜ž
