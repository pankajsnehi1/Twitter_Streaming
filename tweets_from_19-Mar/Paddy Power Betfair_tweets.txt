@paddypower he went down like a sack of potatoes
@paddypower they invented cars after they had all this oil and nowhere to put it. Obviously.
@paddypower good decision by the referee.
@paddypower Letter of the law is that a pen if he's caught whilst shooting? I have no idea. Doesn't happen as often as you would think
@paddypower 'zit fuck
