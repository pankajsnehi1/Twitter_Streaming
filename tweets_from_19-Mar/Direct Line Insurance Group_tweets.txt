@DirectLine_UK 

If I had hit that car
Things would still be fine,
Because I am well insured
Through my awesome 

Direct Line
@DirectLine_UK 
Car pulled out I pressed my brake
As you can see no skid,
And I can prove it Paddy me Boy
With my Dashcam for £30 quid.
@DirectLine_UK this one of many these idiots are everywhere Paddy ha ha ha
@DirectLine_UK £30 Dashcam from Tesco. Worth every penny. https://t.co/Tv9DNEmHxJ
@DirectLine_UK You're best asking @MoneySavingExp that question. I'm sure they have dozens of duel-quote cases.
@MoneySavingExp Yep, @DirectLine_UK are a shady bunch.
@DirectLine_UK  I recently requested an online code. Do I have to do this for all policies.
@DirectLine_UK  I should be able to access all my policies in the one account and not keep being directed to other log in pages.
@DirectLine_UK I created a Direct Line acc. for my home ins. &amp; used links to set up other policies. In my acc. only home ins. shows
@DirectLine_UK ...I love all my policies with Direct Line and the prices, however, the website to access them is terrible.
@DirectLine_UK just sent it, thanks for your help.
@DirectLine_UK I'm almost a month into my policy with you. If I want to add someone to my insurance will I pay more/get money back?
.@DirectLine_UK terrible customer service with your Legal Dep trying to solicit a claim out of me on the other party. is that even legal?
@DirectLine_UK will you insure me against eviction by a landlord who's evicting me for rent arrears when I'm a struggling tenant?
Because as you make clear, the landlord can relax until the tenant is "out" because @DirectLine_UK will cover the rental income.
@DirectLine_UK is the next advert Winston Wolf visiting a struggling tenant to suggest they pay their fucking rent?
@DirectLine_UK but that's ok because the struggling tenant doesn't matter a shit it's the landlord that Winston Wolf is there to console.
@DirectLine_UK private landlords can't sleep at night because they have tenants who are struggling to pay their rent.
@DirectLine_UK it has come to my attention that you are selling non rental payment insurance to private landlords.
