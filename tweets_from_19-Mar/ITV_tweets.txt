Nice to have Vera back of a Sunday night @ITV @BrendaBlethyn. Top quality drama. Great advert for Northumberland tourism too, murders aside.
@loosewomen @RuthieeL @LindaRobson58 @StaceySolomon @janem @PaulHollywood @ITV . Cheltenham Races err,  should have been on a sport channel
Thank you for the great publicity for #Northumberland @BrendaBlethyn @AnnCleeves @ITV #Vera https://t.co/ao4iQ5WRlN
First time iv ever watched Vera and I really enjoyed it @ITV 
#VERA #itv
@itv #Vera didn't think of it tonite thought it was abit to slow sorry just saying
Has @itv gone back to the 70s? 3 times this weekend, the punchline has now ended up being a male presenter 'hilariously' wearing high heels.
I notice someone clever at @ITV starts a new series of #Vera the day before Dame Vera Lynn turns 100.
So glad to have #Vera back on our screens. Brill drama from @ITV and  love @BrendaBlethyn as Vera.
A great episode of #VERA superb acting as ever @BrendaBlethyn @ITV 😚
@Ianhwatkins @llatchfordevans @ITV @ITVLorraine @OfficialSteps still got all five of my dolls still boxed 😊😊😍
Wow. where did that 2 hours go? #Vera and @BrendaBlethyn is back at her usual brilliance. Roll on next week @ITV #WhoDunIt?

@claire_goose Thanks for the retweet, Claire. Can only hope that @ITV gets the message that Sunday at 8pm is what #thecoroner was made for.
@AmyMarieBailey @ITV @MrPeterAndre never ever ever😂 it wouldn't have been so bad if we'd have seen him!😂😂

Have you set your TV reminders yet?!  Starting tomorrow, catch my stepsister and I on @ITV at 3pm #choppingblock 🍤🍗🍋
@ITV Why do you continue to throw money at the nightly show it's unfunny puerile crap but at £50k a week no wonder you get shite presenters
@Ianhwatkins @llatchfordevans @ITV @ITVLorraine @OfficialSteps we have the full set all on display in the music library x
Dear @ITV,
Please snap up the rights to @SallyAbbott3's #thecoroner, starring @claire_goose and @mattbardock.
The viewers want more!

@Dumbcara @PFNicholls @chamberlinsport @ITV next saturday...family fortunes &amp; bargain shop wars on ITV1. Is that good for racing?
@ITV - Do you comprehend how irritating it is to STILL not have yesterday's Eng v Ire game on catch-up unless I use a portable device??
@thevoiceuk @ITV
@thevoiceuk @ITV he looks like Louis Tomlinson
@pestononsunday @Peston @ITV @NicolaSturgeon @AlunCairns @RSAMatthew @NickyMorgan01 @SKinnock @themiltonjones not watching never #LibDems on
@Riley_Jones_88 But they couldn't do Vera @ITV without the great acting!
@Dumbcara @WattyRacing @PFNicholls @chamberlinsport not even the next week, the next day!! What was on @ITV instead?
@itvracing @ITV more terrible presenting/commentary (excluding @MCYeeehaaa and Alice Plunkett) to come at Aintree. #EnoughIsEnough
@ITV is there any intention to add a favourite list feature to your player app?
@ChrisEubankJr interestingly @ITV haven't announced there next fight date if you run back to @EddieHearn you might have a slim chance

@jam73e @joefattorini @ITV missed it, so it changed slots needs to be on the bbc,think it will be bigger than bake off with this format!
@ITV hardly surprising that The Voice has lost half its viewers. When will ITV learn!
