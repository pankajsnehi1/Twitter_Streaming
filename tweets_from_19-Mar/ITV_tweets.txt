First time iv ever watched Vera and I really enjoyed it @ITV 
#VERA #itv
@itv #Vera didn't think of it tonite thought it was abit to slow sorry just saying
Has @itv gone back to the 70s? 3 times this weekend, the punchline has now ended up being a male presenter 'hilariously' wearing high heels.
I notice someone clever at @ITV starts a new series of #Vera the day before Dame Vera Lynn turns 100.
So glad to have #Vera back on our screens. Brill drama from @ITV and  love @BrendaBlethyn as Vera.
