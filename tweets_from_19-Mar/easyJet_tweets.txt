Absolutely appalling customer service from @easyJet don't know why I bother. Ongoing problem for 9 months and you can't even reply to my DM.
@easyJet what's happened to the Glasgow flight from Luton?  It's coming up as 'diverted'
@easyJet can you confirm which airport flight ezy071 will land as I'm picking someone up? Thanks!

Fair play to @easyJet consistent! Flown twice with them this year. Both times flight delayed due to planes not being present #Berlinairport
@easyJet Our flight EZY2146 from Berlin to London Luton is delayed 2 hours... Our trip on Friday was delayed as well. Really bad service!

@easyJet Hi easy jet, could you provide me with the number of your Dutch office ?
Not told about a delay. Hand-luggage taken away and penned in a box with all sat on the floor. All before the plane turned up. Thx @easyJet
@easyJet https://t.co/fO05Xs4j9Q
@easyJet and we get stuck at Manchester airport for 4 hours waiting for a bus because our plane is late, no help from anyone at easyJet.
@easyJet our flight is delayed by 4 hours and all we get is a ¬£3 voucher that's not even enough to buy a meal, ridiculous
@easyJet was the question too hard?
The worlds worst airline. @easyJet Your customer service is crap. Your level of empathy is none. You're delayed.
@easyJet Hi. We are scheduled to depart at 21.35 from Gva to LGW. We are at the gate, it's 21.23. No announcement.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/UpNvUp6CyU
@charlottemcvx @easyJet fact. This has been ridiculous like. Got declined at the bag check-in despite my boarding pass saying "Y E S"

@easyJet Despite presenting this boarding pass I was told I couldn't bring my hold luggage tonight. Opinion on this‚Ä¶ https://t.co/5lGq5K4eXW
@easyJet Does pre-purchasing a seat still come with speedy boarding even though SB is no longer printed on the boarding pass?
Back on UK soil...well will be when they find the gate and steps. Love #Lisbon. Thank you @easyJet. Great flights and early arrival at Luton
So @easyjet delay my flight by over 2hrs yet they don't even have charging ports so passengers can recharge phones. Surely you can do better

Hi @easyJet what's the point of baggage policy if u don't enforce? EZY6956 Paris CDG to Edinburgh. 50% passengers carrying on 2 bags min.
@easyJet what's going on with flight EZY8282 ???
@easyJet all your staff needed to do was just talk to us, not make us free for all for information!
@easyJet now not serving drinks, 1 hour delay already, no communication from your staff either, just telling said stand to side!
@easyJet absolute shambles! Just spent the last 30 minutes being told they weren't sure me and my family had seats, now been split up!
@easyJet 7.05pm flight to Luton so disorganised. Some people weren't sure they had a seat &amp; no drinks being served?! Still waiting 2 go!
@easyJet No other solution? No answer?
@easyJet @berlinairport awful experience today, stuck in a baking hot room with no A/C or anywhere to sit. Need to up your game
@easyJet Stunning views from your 12 o'clock leaving Iceland today - great crew too ;-) https://t.co/7mRyalVfuE
@easyJet already distressed due to delays and then your staff lets 2 standby's on with luggage but we need to check ours in.unacceptable!

@easyJet passive aggressive= not acceptable.if a passenger is on standby they shouldn't get better treatment than a booked customer!
@easyJet it's not acceptable that you let customers be treated like this. We are the ones that made you a successful airline!
@easyJet sorry but it's not acceptable to say sorry and pretend staff is nice when really they are passive aggressive.
@easyJet absolute shambles boarding EZY72. Not enough seats for passengers, no information until gate. Then told to wait by the side!
@schuilr @easyJet thank U
@easyJet Flight is Friday and all your website is doing is sending me back to the same page
@easyJet Cancelling our 16:10 NAP-AMS flight today and offering a next flight on WEDNESDAY??!! You got to be kidding me! #Fail

@easyJet train your staff to not be passive aggressive.My hand luggage must be checked in but two standby customers can go in with two bags!
@easyJet I had a bad experience on your 12:40 flight from schipol to Gatwick.2hour delay + passive aggressive staff member - not acceptable!

Shysters @easyJet now purposely overbook all flights and then claim they have passengers 'on standby' when really they just checked in last.
Thanks @easyJet for making me put all my things in cabin bag only to have to take it all out again as going in the hold. Rude staff too.
@easyJet need to sort out their CS staff!! Just had the most annoying conversation!! Hasn't filled me with the best of confidence!

I love @easyJet auto check in at Gatwick North - deserted (admittedly is a Sunday in March but still...) https://t.co/QP9bQdUMQc
Dear @easyJet
I can accept 1h delay due to health issues and weather.
But please turn the climate control to warm #freezingColdFlight

@British_Airways doesn't have separate recycle collection systems for papers, bottles etc. on the  flight. Even @easyJet has better system.
@easyJet travelling with an infant, are there restrictions on the size of car seat you can check in? Does it have to be a baby carrier?

Delays never good but the captains speech on EZY8873 was very jolly and made it not seem so bad!! @easyJet
@easyJet Can you please confirm restrictions on paste/clay in hand luggage? My hair product is measured in ounces and grams, not ml. Thanks.
@easyJet are cameras now considered add on luggage? Nothing more frustrating than an inconsistent baggage policy. #checkin #easyjet #camera
@easyJet Can I just clarify that if I'm taking a small instrument as hand luggage, that I can take a small handbag too?
@easyJet oh for the love of God! Just ONE time please be on time!

Shame on you, @easyJet - your cabin baggage policy is the worst I've seen in 20+ years of flying.
@easyJet  yes but 3 of ur ground staff said it is like this every Saturday @munichairport. So why didn't we get any warning at check in?

@easyJet Excellent flight thanks ;-), but it's not the topic. I am looking for realtime and useful information on your app.

@easyJet what's your Glasgow customer service number? My sis is stranded there &amp; it's impossible to find a number
@easyJet when I phoned your customer service they gave me an incorrect number for Glasgow
Nothing easy about @easyJet when are you going to allow a little purse next to hand luggage without having to pay 60eu extra? #CX
@easyJet they haven't told us when taxis will pick us up from arranged hotel for rescheduled flight today

@easyJet when are flights released for December 2017?
@easyJet one more stupid airline policy. Cramming two bags into one makes them lighter? Just more passenger hassle
Flying @British_Airways &amp;so disappointed they've gone the route of @easyJet charging even for coffee!Why pay more then if no added comfort?

@LDNLutonAirport Often delayed due to staff shortage on ground. Will it ever get better? @easyJet
@TomShimali @easyJet   And you could do without that stress as this break is meant to be relaxing as you both thoroughly deserve it xx
@TomShimali @easyJet Thought luggage space was first come first served but everyone an allowance of 1 small case.  I'd feel upset too. Awful
@easyJet Please do not quote "If the lockers are full ... we‚Äôll put it into the aircraft hold for free." Fine if it's full but it wasn't.
@Why do you have to wait so long before you can checkin online with @British_Airways. Even @easyJet  is better in this, and other ways!
@easyJet I expect to have a suggested resolution to this by the time we land in 4 hours. Terrible service from your Gatwick team.
@easyJet and now the last passengers have just boarded 15 minutes later and brought on cabin bags. ARE YOU F***KING KIDDING ME?!?
