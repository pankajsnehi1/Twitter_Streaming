@FreaKyCoD @SkyUK depends what area tho, my mate gets 50Mb down
And on top of that promising a reimbursement for this and then failing to do so. Terrible service so far. @SkyUK

@SkyUK now I have spent 45 minutes being transferred to wrong departments to cancel my order. What is wrong with you?
@SkyUK do you accept requests for movies on Sky Cinema??
@SkyUK I added multi room onto my package. I have the lot. To then be told I had to pay £40 upfront when that wasn't explained online?
@SkyUK stopped skygo working on chrome so I had to switch to Firefox.....now they've stopped that too? Sort it out!

@lewmoses9 @bt_uk been charging us x2 since August mate. When it was fixed BT sport was switched off! Still no real apology. Go with @SkyUK
@SkyUK Hi, having trouble connecting to broadband. Some days it works and others it doesn't.
Sky Q connection rubbish since day 1 &amp; now lost connection totally. @SkyUK have no engineer slots for 3wks! Time to find new provider.
Being with a company for 3yr gets u no loyalty.Not great for @Virgin who pride themselves on customer satisfaction. Off to @SkyUK or @bt_uk
@SkyUK I pay £110 a month for tv+broadband but I need to pay extra to get bt sports! It's a disgrace the money you ask us to pay each month.
Why the hell is the spurs game on sky1? What the hell am i paying for skysport for?  Been showing movies all week too. @SkyUK #ripoff
@SkyUK  You provide the shittest Internet in the UK FFS!
@SkyUK breaking their promises after not providing the service paid for !
Appalling customer service from @SkyUK what do I need to do to switch to @virginmedia
Getting so annoyed with @SkyUK
@SkyUK can you have more than 1 minibox on a 1tb sky q set up, I would like to put a 2nd minibox on a tv in a bedroom
@SkyUK technical fault on every channel, why?
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK my broadband is so poor that playing a video over 4G is QUICKER. Shocking #customerexperience #customerservice
I spend more time rebooting my @SkyUK Q box than actually watching it. 😪
@SkyUK I'm halfway through #thewalkingdeaduk and you are removing from boxsets.  can you extend it so I can catch-up to the current season??
Is it my @SkyUK Q box or is @TheGadgetShow on @channel5_tv really blurry.
Is there any problems with @SkyUK #immissingthefootball
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK I got rid of SkyQ and went back to HD for same reason it's not fit for purpose so many problems with it never works!
Obviously 17 years loyalty mean nothing to companies like @SkyUK also found being charged for stuff I never asked for!
What a RIP OFF! @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam £5.49 renting a film for only 24hrs from sky store &amp; we don't get told about the change. Disgusting.
just signed up to @SkyUK switching from virgin. The sales guy was ace in Trafford Centre-really good at his job 👍👍
I cancelled @SkyUK @SkySports because of Neil McCann.
If you ever get rid of him let me know and I may come back as a customer
Thats another 20 quid a month in our pocket. Thanks @SkyUK great deal given @intuTrafford well worth the trip out.

Starting to get really annoyed that still not got wifi. @SkyUK tell me the issue is with @OpenreachGB but just dragging on and on.
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam any help with this please? You are making it very easy for me to leave if this isnt resolved asap. #customerexperience

@SkyUK Yet again I'm having to turn off wifi &amp; use my 4G as internet either slower than a tortoise or losing wifi to Sky Q box's #rubbish
@nectar can I collect points for being a @SkyUK customer???
My sky fibre is so bad that I can't even watch a YouTube vid in one go. What a waste of money. So glad I'm in a 12 month contact @SkyUK
@SkyUK How many times do you need me to confirm an Engineer's visit? Why do you keep sending me texts about it?
I will be cancelling my full @SkyUK  package next month , Sky against everything good in Scotland !
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam fibre max with the hub 3 it's the worst connection I've had since dial up. https://t.co/eU4BLOgFOd
@SkyUK sad that after 1 year with sky they think it is acceptable to double my monthly fee. Cancellation will happen in one month Countdown
Been waiting over a month now for @SkyUK home move to come to install tv and another no show yesterday. And no help from @SkyHelpTeam
As a family we are not huge TV watchers but @SkyUK Q is superb. #skyq

I've had the £££ Sky Q for a year and a day hasn't gone by when it doesn't work. All fur coat and no knickers. Shocking! @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam

Dear @SkyUK - The Sky Q touch remote control is an absolute disaster!! Every time I pick it up it does something unwanted. Do. Not. Like.
@SkyUK So I record the football today, come home to watch it and it freezes every minute. Pathetic service! Not paying £65 we're cancelling!
Congratulations! @SkyUK! For making internet explorer relevant again! It's the only browser I can use sky go on. @Microsoft must be chuffed!
@SkyUK Forget that we get signal 1/2 the day every single day for the past 6 months. Frustrated! https://t.co/MUnaKU6Lix
