@PersimmonHomes my furniture ruined thanks to your cowboy building! And 2 years later I'm still no further forward! https://t.co/A8q3bW6U6s
@PersimmonHomes and your Doncaster and Scunthorpe representatives both couldn't be bothered to help us as we are buying on another site[2/2]
@PersimmonHomes the customer service we have received is an utter disgrace! We are looking to spend a lot of money with you...[1/2]
@BBCXRay we live in a Persimmon home. Appalling drainage in our and neighbours gardens. @PersimmonHomes totally ineffective! Disgraceful
