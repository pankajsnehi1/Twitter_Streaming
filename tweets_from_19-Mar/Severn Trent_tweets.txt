@stwater ....I have a 7 month old who is currently asleep!! Just put down call 3 to get call 4 really???! Cmon now
@stwater thank you.
@stwater seriously 3 calls telling me the same thing in 2 minutes despite me pressing 1 to advise no more updates!! It's late and.....
@stwater thanks for scaring the crap out of us and disturbing our baby daughter with endless bloody phone calls about water disruption :(
@stwater thanks so much for the phone call scaring us half to death here's hoping the 7 month old isn't disturbed!!
@stwater great, thanks for the swift reply.
@stwater hi, I work for BBC emt. Could you confirm how many homes/biz affected? Some media saying 7.5k is that correct? Thanks
@stwater will you inform when?
@stwater Why are addreesses in DE23 affected when we're not even close the the damaged water main?? 2nd time in 6 months we've been cut off.
@stwater this was posted 12 hours ago, why has it only just gone from DE23????
@stwater no running water in DE23 this evening after 8pm. No contact from st. Absolute shambles
@stwater I can't access the webpage, "not available".
@stwater thanks just wanted it clear I'm not part of @crimewarrior complaint! Ur responses hve been more than satisfactory #longnight
@stwater Thanks, just had to inform my neighbours of this. Perhaps more info on social media would be helpful?
@CrimeWarrior pls untag me in ur tweets 2 @stwater! just wanted 2 add more info 2 ur earlier comment I have no part in ur complaint. Thanks
@stwater @grancake is the discoloration due to the burst water main on Church Lane?
@stuartmagic @stwater hi Stuart, we are at no 47 Harper avenue, we have a trickle. You are more than welcome to fill a kettle, Sarah
@stwater @wildjevo (2/2) from last night's burst main. Is there an estimated time for return of supply?
@stwater @wildjevo I still don't understand why it's been fine all day &amp; supply turned off this evening. We are more than 3 miles from (1/2)
@stwater @wildjevo An operative who arrived in STW van to turn the supply off, it would appear
@stwater returned from weekend away &amp; no water! Supply problems in DE23?
@stwater Littleover, Harpur Avenue, still no water been off all day when will we be connected - even a trickle would be better than nothing
@stwater had 3 missed calls from you in Newcastle under Lyme area, thought odd as quite late, any ideas? Thanks.
@stwater that's fine thnx saw news re burst on Mansfield Rd so I guess thats some warning have stocked up bottled h2o for now, good luck!
@stwater @wildjevo We'll that's worse. He saw me coming out of my house &amp; could have said something! This really isn't acceptable
@stwater  @wildjevo Can you check it's not been turned off in error. It seems to have coincided with water supply being turned back on
@stwater, I noticed you have screwed up a status update and meant to tweet ‚Äúor we would['ve] updated‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòHave‚Äô is a real verb.
@stwater @wildjevo But why only in the last hour ... and if you'd let people know in advance we wouldn't be stuck.
@stwater my supply hasn't been affected; I wondered if I should expect to be disconnected as part of the repairs?
@stwater Does low pressure issues mean a trickle from the tap?
@stwater @thegolddisc Be nice to have water!!!! Why has Littleover supply been shut off in last hour?
@stwater Can some one please advise why water turned off in Littleover around 6pm? Can't get thru on phone. DM not picked up
@CrimeWarrior @stwater we're Littleover too, no water since 6.15pm - no warning until kids bath used up last in pipes
@stwater @jamesrfortune Ours disconnected it Littleover with no warning and we're nowhere near Mansfield Rd!!!
@stwater oh and are you planning on disconnecting my water supply?!
@stwater it's the Mansfield Road burst main.
