@thecarolemalone @ITV dumbed down tv
@GordonRamsay You've broken @ITV, mate üòÇ #TheNightlyShow https://t.co/ea0i0dVH8w
@ITV when are you uploading the new episode of Broadchurch to itv player??? I need so many answers
I found #thenightlyshow with @GordonRamsay very insensitive considering the recent tragic events in London. #notfunny @ITV
@trendyredmac @ITV how can i watch it?
@PaulGreig69 @ITV Gordon Ramsay is fuckin class
@ITV @GordonRamsay #thenightlyshow *
@ITV # the nightly show  maybe Jamie Oliver would have
@THEJamesWhale @ITV   Terrible show anyway but after last weeks events !
@bekk_11 @ITV ruined it by putting nightly shit back on
@ITV #thenightlyshow announced as a joke, the blender scene was disgusting. The break in service was very apt, take it off the air.
@itvcorrie @ITV what's the song being played over the coronation street advert called?
@ITV where is broadchurch at?
@ITVNightlyShow @GordonRamsay @ITV get this rubbish off the air NOT FUNNY NOT ENTERTAINMENT quite frankly a disgrace and unworthy of airtime
@PaulGreig69 @ITV me too! Can‚Äôt believe he is so successful?!!!
@ITV @GordonRamsay definitely the best host yet.
Gordon Ramsay has broken @ITV
@BroadchurchTV @ITV Michael Lucas is the rapist and the illegitimate child of Ed Burnett who's in love with Trish.
@THEJamesWhale @ITV Eh? What has what happened in London last week got to do with the nightly show?
@Sadler08 @ITV I think so! He's touched all the evidence in front of police, so they're not surprised if his DNA is on it?
@airtoursgirl @ITV  They really have
@ITV what happened?
OMG! Ken! @itvcorrie #KenBarlow #CoronationStreet @ITV https://t.co/k0sArMBvvg
Was enjoying @GordonRamsay on the Nighty Show as well!! @ITV
