@AskLloydsBank hi, does having an overdraft affect your credit rating/store?
@AskLloydsBank No they haven't because I only tried applying for the accounts today
@AskLloydsBank Basic, but since I applied for a current account already I can't apply for it till 30 days has passed
@AskLloydsBank maybe because I already tried applying for the Club Lloyds Account?
@AskLloydsBank Got at the end of the Current Account application, "Sorry we are unable to offer this account, please try again in 30 days" &gt;
@AskLloydsBank Why must I apply for another account with you in 30 days after trying to apply for the Club Lloyds one and failed for it
