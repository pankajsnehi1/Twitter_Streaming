@AgainstSugarTax @Channel4 @CocaCola @CocaCola_GB most tax is.
@menhealuk @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB agreed researchers are like the rest of us, no bias just facts
And this - @CocaCola_GB #obesity #business #ethics it mentions UCL @RichardMoorhead https://t.co/jhxjJDyrG8
If you didn't see this, you really should - @C4Dispatches on @CocaColaCo @CocaCola_GB #CorpGov #lobbying #sugartax https://t.co/eX9VqMe1Jp
@menhealuk @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB I respectfully have to disagree, parents raise kids not corporations.
@SeanJC @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB Just goes to show researchers massively fall for ignorance and bias just like the rest of us.
@SeanJC @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB Well your response was ignorant and damaging. You should know better working for the NHS.
@menhealuk @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB Nope.
@SeanJC @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB Have you ever received money from the food industry for research? Thanks.
@menhealuk @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB My latest work is the NHS don't work for the soft drinks industry.
@SeanJC @soph_1808 @CocaCola_GB Says someone working for the corrupt industry that is marketing. Haha. Negligent views Sean.
@CocaCola_GB thank you for helping me get through this term at university ‚ò∫ https://t.co/NoXnNOzJ9E
@StephenDCook @Channel4 @CocaCola @CocaCola_GB It's a tax on poorer people.
@knitknitqueen @CocaCola_GB Got to love urban myths.
#Dispatches Why pick on @CocaCola_GB. with sugar and obesity? What about chocolate, cereals, cakes? Sugar tax will be a waste of time.
The @C4Dispatches focus on @CocaCola_GB makes an unfair example of their practices. Should make that clear most corporates act in  same way
Can't help feel @C4Dispatches should rename itself Witch-hunt after it's sensationalism on @CocaCola_GB - what next? Unmask Ronald McDonald?
@knitknitqueen @CocaCola_GB Must keep that in mind!
@CocaCola @CocaCola_GB @CocaColaCo PLUS getting 12yr olds to do Zumba for however long to 'burn off' a bottle is a bit careless  #greatbrand
Excellent prog from @C4Dispatches if even halve of what they are saying about @CocaCola_GB is true then there needs to be serious change.
@OMG_ImSoAwesome @CocaCola_GB use a litre bottle + and leave your loo for 30 mins then flush...
Do you know what would be hilarious? If @CocaCola_GB purchased advertising during this @C4Dispatches episode #dispatches
Hmmmmmm @CocaCola @CocaCola_GB @CocaColaCo I wouldn't worry too much about #Dispatches it's a little too worthy. Plus #moderation
@knitknitqueen @CocaCola_GB Thanks for the life hack! üôå
It's not @CocaCola_GB job to manage how much sugar your kids eat, it's the parents job #dispatches
@knitknitqueen @CocaCola_GB and any loose change
@CocaCola_GB is very good for cleaning the toilet... #dispatches
