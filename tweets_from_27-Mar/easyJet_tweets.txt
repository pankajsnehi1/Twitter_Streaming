@easyJet Why is my EZY8210 flight currently listed as leaving 30 minutes late,  but expected to leave on time?
Oops @easyJet you tell me to be at the gate on time even with the delay - but you guys aren't here yourselves! https://t.co/iGykzAY3CZ
@easyJet how can i file my delay compensation claim for flight EZY9248?
@Stevedubwin @SkyNews @easyJet listen if enough people stop using a company or buyin products that's exactly how it works!
What would be really good now would be an aircraft. @easyJet have known for long enough a few chaps might want to travel today...

@Gatwick_Airport @easyJet https://t.co/UCxKgONGkg
Record numbers failing simple intelligence test of finding their allocated seat  this morning. Time for @easyJet to introduce iq test!?
@easyJet automated announcement of boarding not working gate 55c. Staff no initiative. No call for flight, +cards or ppl with with kids.
@TiphDltg @easyJet with a bike you're never late üòÇ
At the Airport waiting for our flight @easyJet
@easyJet you allow infants 10kg for pram &amp; car seat etc. Our pram weighs 12.5kg - will this be ok?? Thanks
@easyJet no response or acknowledgement to my email  regarding my broken @babyjogger pushchair from my flight on Friday 24/3
Every time I fly @easyJet I wish i was on @ryanair. This time, they oversold the flight so I couldn't check in, 5.30am and on standby. Great
@easyJet great start to the week a 4 hour delay. https://t.co/V20vvDAWEF
@IanJamesBailey

@easyJet 80 people on the flight back from Cyprus got to lay down and sleep the whole way. Perfect thank you üòä#3SeatsForPriceOfOne
@easyJet feeling anxious after saying goodbye to my son on a school trip to Sorrento.  0600 flight Stansted to Naples.   Look after them.
@easyJet I can clearly see you're hoping that he will give up, which is unfair. I want a direct line he can contact to receive money owed.
@easyJet My dad has been trying to claim his compensation for months. The tactics you have used not only cause delay but distress too.
@easyJet EZY8016 worst flight ever. Delayed by 3 Hours with no consideration from the staff &amp; only a beverage as compensation. What a treat.
