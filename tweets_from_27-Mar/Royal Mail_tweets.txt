@RoyalMail  @TicketmasterUK had presumably paid you to track it, and it wasn't where your track system said.
@RoyalMail I have already followed and DM'd with my redelivery number
@RoyalMail I have it now - but it clearly wasn't where your track system said it was. So, pretty hopeless, as tracking goes.
@RoyalMail your employee accepted a signature from someone who is quite clearly a different sex. That is my issue. What are you not getting?

@RoyalMail yes. As I keep saying.
@RoyalMail Thanks for getting back to me. Just glad I checked before I sent it. :)
