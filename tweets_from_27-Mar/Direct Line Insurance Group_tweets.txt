@DirectLine_UK Hi. How far will the taxi take me after an accident? Would it take me like 300 miles?
@DirectLine_UK why is your webchat unavailable even though it's in the hours you're open https://t.co/8OhOBG7pH9

@DirectLine_UK Too late! I'm already cancelling my policies as they come up for renewal. #justawful
@DirectLine_UK yes I've tried various email addresses.
@DirectLine_UK it keeps telling me my details have changed. We have more than one person at the address but it won't let me get a quote
Wow the @DirectLine_UK website has to be the worst I've ever come across. I just want a bloody quote ðŸ˜©
@djpbut @DirectLine_UK  Yep.They'd rather lose my 4 separate insurances I have with them than renew at previous premium. ðŸ™‹
@f1mrfox @DirectLine_UK that's how they make the money. ...
@djpbut @DirectLine_UK They couldn't even explain why, just a whole lot of.."Oh my, that is a lot." They hope people don't chase it up.
@f1mrfox @DirectLine_UK direct profit more like!ðŸ˜‚
@BDaw50n @DirectLine_UK  Nope, I failed to put per month too incase it wasn't clear
