Your great grandchildren are being indebted to subsidise @Tesco poor wages, to the tune of ¬£136,000 per yr per store, in the UK.
@Tesco I'm more annoyed that they gave it than me receiving it.
@JKnightOnline @StopFundingHate @coopuk Don't forget @marksandspenc @Tesco @AldiUK @Morrisons are also advertisers
@Tesco They'll deny they gave it to me. So I'm not going back to return it.
@Tesco it was the one in Bournemouth square, 11 Bourne close, I think is the address
@Tesco Shouldn't be giving it out in the 1st place. If they have received it by mistake at least put it to the side.
