@Tesco hi will your trolleys and self service being taking the new pound coin tomorrow ?
@Tesco so they are getting new self service machines
Very disappointed with the results of the cupcakes advertised, caramel didn't set,cupcakes dry. What a waste of money &amp; time @Tesco
@Tesco you no longer have an Australian section at the big tesvo in shepherds bush. Where else can I get shapes, Tim tams etc?
@Tesco Bought some milk last week, date of 29/03. Kept in the fridge but was sour yesterday morning! No point crying but can I return it?
@NairnsOatcakes gluten free chocolate chip biscuit breaks r DELICIOUS. Being made to go gluten free was eased by the great range at @Tesco
@Tesco Hi Ben, I can return the packaging and the rock, but no longer have the receipt I'm afraid! Will this cause an issue?
@Tesco  Your English butter price  rise of 15p per packet, needed  to pay your fine  after Serious Fraud Squad investigation.  #ripofftesco
@Tesco hi that's great thanks, was just curious :)
@Tesco please can you advise if you label halal meat (Tesco brand) or not? Thanks
@Tesco I got the recipe from my local store but as I was making double I used tinned chopped tomatoes and added my own garlic &amp; olive oil
@Tesco  Tesco English butter price increase of 15p in one go.  21st March £1.09 26th March £1.24 obviously will be blaming Brexit.
@JenniferRamsay @Tesco same 🙈

I'm really disappointed with @Tesco's memory foam slippers. I wore them for 3 evenings and 1 day and they've already lost their shape.

Your great grandchildren are being indebted to subsidise @Tesco poor wages, to the tune of £136,000 per yr per store, in the UK.
@Tesco I'm more annoyed that they gave it than me receiving it.
@JKnightOnline @StopFundingHate @coopuk Don't forget @marksandspenc @Tesco @AldiUK @Morrisons are also advertisers
@Tesco They'll deny they gave it to me. So I'm not going back to return it.
@Tesco it was the one in Bournemouth square, 11 Bourne close, I think is the address
@Tesco Shouldn't be giving it out in the 1st place. If they have received it by mistake at least put it to the side.

@Tesco surely Tesco GB is as keen on improving Air Quality as Tesco Ireland? So why not charging points in Brixton?
@standardnews I had the same experience with @Tesco -bought on Sat, dead by Sun, got a refund later in the day &amp; went to @waitrose instead
So my local @Tesco metro had bare, unstocked sandwich fridges like half an hour after it open
@Tesco Your own pizza was great value and the tastiest Dr Oetker one was from your store, Goodfellas was the letdown :( 2/2
@Tesco Thank you for the offer of a refund but this is not necessary (and I don't have the relevant details any more). 1/2
@Tesco is that all you have to say "Refund !!!!! " - what a joke
Funny how the customer service gets 100 times better when there seems to be 'royal' visit taking place at @Tesco Sandhurst #callmesceptical
