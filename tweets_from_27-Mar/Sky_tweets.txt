INTERNET GONE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EPISODE OF THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, give me answers @SkyUK
@SkyUK Why have I suddenly lost access to ALL on demand features???
@SkyUK https://t.co/ioe35cEVuD                            Worst WiFi ever.

#QueremosContinuaComVC

@SkyUK get Ma account upped to over 18 #pornhub
Dear @SkyUK, problem with boxsets, won't let me download Blindspot in SD anymore. I'm 10 episodes in on S1. Will allow S2 SD content?
@SkyUK why does my Sky Q keep cutting out every ten minutes? If we pay so much for each month, then surely it should work properly.
This is when I wish I could afford @SkyUK multi room- just starting tonight's @BroadchurchTV but I'm sooooo tired 😴 #IWantMyBed
@SkyUK @DisneyXDUK Could I ask why the season finale of Star Wars Rebels is not on catch up?
@imadamsavage @GinxTV @SkyUK @YouTube it's like a proper tv show and everything!
@SkyUK Hi when will season 5 of Baby Daddy be on box sets? Thanks :)
@SkyUK will be responsible for me failing my assignment...their internet is shocking 😩
Please send a message to @Ofcom and encourage them to block #RupertMurdoch’s @SkyUK power-grab - 
https://t.co/xd3oAhOY66
Booooooooo!! When @SkyUK fcuks up and doesn't air s12 ep14 of criminal minds..... https://t.co/xwhk0UUHMZ
How come @SkyUK can play @CrimMinds_CBS one week and the next week it's not on! I just want to watch the new episodes 👌
@SkyUK where's the part where you have to buy another box to be able to do that?
@TheCarteI @DetroitBORG @SkyUK Thing with BT is that they like to increase prices every day
@bilalmuhammed21 @DetroitBORG @SkyUK BT - you need FTTP to get that though. FTTC is still true unlimited 70mb for £20 though
@DetroitBORG This is a joke. I feel so bad for you 😂 @SkyUK is shit aswell
@SkyUK get it together both fox channels not working and all I want to do is watch @WalkingDead_AMC  it's a joke
When your @SkyUK Q box has to be replaced and you lose all your recordings/scheduled recordings 🙃🙃🙃🙃 #firstworldproblems #butabigone #tysky
@SkyUK why does this stupid sky go player only give me sound but no video 😡
@SkyUK since the clock change everything been recording an hour late (so wrong show) but the time displays as correct
Why does the talking dead keep recording when I record the walking dead 💀 @SkyUK
@SkyUK maybe @SkyHelpTeam will chase up 😂
Still no call from @SkyUK there is a surprise! Nearly a week waiting for a complaint call back
@WylieGeoff what will @SkyUK say about their poor cust service if put it on here. No phone or broadband for 5days #badattitudes #poorservice
If my @SkyUK box keeps not recording set programmes it's getting thrown out my house and I'll be going elsewhere!!!
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK  any way we can download whole series' off boxsets, having to download The Flash episodes one at a time
@Forefather2003 @SkyUK Rip off mate ... had the same Box from sky for 7 years now they want £200 sheets for this 🙃
@SkyUK very annoyed by lack of my problem by customer service.First agent assured me issue would be resolved so no confidence in 2nd agent.
@SkyUK this can't be right ?? 3mbps ?? https://t.co/6324vPDqvM
@MyBigMouth1707 @SkyUK dont pay it
@SkyUK got my sky q set up but can't use it as never received my viewing card!!!
@SkyUK After an hour of waiting (8:21-9:21), I am forcefully disconnected and chat closed. Pathetic #SkyTV https://t.co/lSpQJIqAXn
My @SkyUK internet is down again so im having to tether from my phone to finish a post
@lady_primrose @SkyUK +1 it?
@SkyUK box didn't record AGAIN and now I have to wait for #broadchurch to be available on iPlayer 😡 #rage. #skyq is not worth the hassle
@virginmedia I think u r missing the point. Your company obviously doesn't care for me as a customer. Even @SkyUK do decent retention deals
@SkyUK My #SkyQ is ace now Fibre is sorted; Ultra HD is great too #HappyCustomer
@SkyUK #customerservice a total joke, btw. Hours on the phone, rare timely updates and no compensation @ofcom @WatchdogBBC
@SkyUK should compensate users for misleading, inexistant offers/upgrades, even if @OpenreachGB are also to blame @WatchdogBBC @ofcom #fail
The wifi in Syria is 100% better than the wifi in my bedroom. @SkyUK your internet is bollox.
@SkyUK what's happened the episode (14) of the current criminal minds series (12), we have random episodes from series 11 instead??? 😬😬

@SkyUK blames it on @OpenreachGB But is it OpRch fault if Sky decides to set a date to a service they haven't verified? @WatchdogBBC #poorQA
@SkyUK and needless to say, not even a penny of compensation, despite the many hours on the phone and the money spent in mobile data #fail
Oh no! My 3 months of @SkyUK boxsets has expired! And I still have a season and a half of #TheWestWing to go 😫😫😫

Hmm do I pay Amazon prime £2.49 x 2 for the two missing episodes or will @SkyUK come through me on homeland season 6 episode 3&amp;4 with OD? :)
@SkyUK new skyQ in the bin because it keeps logging out, installed old sky internet
What are we paying for???? https://t.co/2Mh9HvvGmV
Is anyone else finding the new @SkyUK SkyQ remotes the most losable design in the world? Fed up of searching for the damned things.
Would also be nice if @SkyUK answered their phone once in a while
Becoming increasingly bored of @SkyUK broadband service. Can't even cope with a bit of Twitter or FB, have to switch it off and use 4G
@SkyUK your internet is crap
whoo sky go is back working, dont know what yous did but whoo!! @skyuk
@SkyUK I'm finally catching up with homeland season 6 that I put on series link and episode 3 &amp; 4 are missing anywhere I can download OD:(?

@C4OneBorn @All4 can you access that on @SkyUK ?
@imadamsavage @GinxTV @SkyUK @YouTube Awesome virtual tour of your studio
Why does sky go keep going down @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam ?
@teaguer81 @virginmedia @SkyUK here here #virginmedia is 💩
@alecattelan come conduttore dei #david2017 é perfetto!  @SkyUK @TV8it
@SkyUK so apparently I can't watch sky go anymore? https://t.co/YMHkAeUqXN
@SkyUK your fucking shit the wifi is so bad I'm not even calling it wifi anymore
Been on hold to @SkyUK for 25 mins. I'm bored and want my phone &amp; internet back, please. 😒
Why do they only ever show the shitty remastered and tampered versions on TV now @SkyUK #ReturnOfTheJedi
@SkyUK if I want to watch something in UHD are subtitles available? Looking at films but none show the S indicator.
Seems I've not signed into my @SkyUK Yahoo email for 12 months so it's suspended. 
Haha never knew I had one
1 less Yahoo acc to be hacked 😀
@matthewnunn1986 @SkyUK It is indeed. And I'm not changing BB provider. Just upgrading from one @SkyUK hub to another.
@RugbyInReality @SkyUK @bt_uk @virginmedia they have become tougher on the deals they do since @MartinSLewis but I still got a big saving
@swanseasurfer83 @SkyUK I should add I still haven't  heard anything from sky! Perhaps @bt_uk or @virginmedia would like my custom?
@swanseasurfer83 @SkyUK interestingly Sky call centre blame @MartinSLewis for making people have unrealistic expectations!
Been downloading a 49 min show, so far it's taken 40 mins, 42% dl and not available #skyjoke @SkyUK why is it so slow !?
@SkyUK just called your customer service department, apparently closed but also somehow open till 9pm #daylightsavingsfail
@SkyUK sent me something in the post today... Now I just have to set it up and try to wait for Wednesday. @matthewnunn1986
@RugbyInReality @SkyUK just had the same conversation only a week ago. I have sky Q multi room with sports and movies and don't pay that!

@KaveShovir @SkyUK @rooshv I'm now classed as an enemy of the state, a quisling, for trying to access a simple website.
@SkyUK why are freeview channels not available through sky box without a subscription?
Feel bad for @HughesDirect. Did a great job selling us a Sky package only for @SkyUK to screw it up.
@matthewnunn1986 @SkyUK It's free wow that makes a change

@SkyUK Funny how you don't advertise the £200 installation fees
Not happy @SkyUK, tried to downgrade anytimetalk by using MySky, failed. Phoned customer service, they failed. Feels like you are stalling!!

@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK could you ask someone to answer the phones please since you ignore me here.
@series0ne @SkyUK Surely down to limitations of BT infrastructure
@SkyUK upgrade to sky fibre broadband..... still shit!
@SkyUK please stop sending me market material! Not been a customer for 12 months, changed prefs months ago. Very annoyed!
@Delboymcfc @SkyUK doubt it's worth £1bn for that? Wouldnt make that cash back for just CL football

It is unacceptable for @SkyUK to hassle customers seeking to reduce their bills. One more call and I raise a complaint.
@SkyUK I have a technical fault message. It's been like this since 6. Turned off and back on. https://t.co/WMd494AOA1
Just had my 2nd call today from @SkyUK about a change to my TV package that I made. What is wrong with you people? Just do what I asked for!
@virginmedia Yes, cabling to the front needs replacing. With @SkyUK turning off services soon I will be without broadband etc. For a month.
@Butwe82 @SkyUK told you they were shite!
Upgrade to @SkyUK Fibre Unlimited and hey presto, NO INTERNET OR PHONE! #NotHappy #BTOpenreachsFault

@SkyUK so far I'd say there are more downsides than up.
@SkyUK trying to get wifi off you is awful!! 3 weeks and still nothing. Your serves is horrendous. #whatajoke
@JackHayward9 @SkyUK nice tweet bro
@SkyUK no other questions or even hints. No very helpful, looks like I can't ever change my account ever again
Why the fuck is my download speed 300KB/s @SkyUK this isn't 1942 and I'm sure your internet motherboard isn't powered by a hamster.
@SkyUK judging by the conversation I just had with your call centre, there's no protocol for if someone forgets a password. No prompt.....
Watching the ITV @Diversity_Tweet Live programme one last time before we get a new @SkyUK box and I lose my recording 😩
@SkyUK whilst it is great functionality, you really should add "programme must already be recorded or on record to continue in another room"
@SkyUK get the champions league back 👊
wondering what i'm paying for with @SkyUK limited or no signal for the 5th day! #grrrr
@SkyUK 
would consider, but at £200 installation, I think not.
@SkyUK Without interruptions? Don't make me laugh! It drops all the time whenever I use my device. Wish I stayed with Sky+ HD.
@SkyUK What u can't do w/ #SkyQ is set reminders such as 4 events on @SkySportsF1 as Sky mistakenly believe we customers don't want this
To anyone thinking about going with @virginmedia DO NOT!  3 weeks and we are still awaiting a response! Wish we never left @SkyUK
@SkyUK how And I bet you have to pay more
@SkyUK My wife booked a Sky Q installation for today 8-10am. Nothing by 2pm. Two calls to Sky later, still can't tell us anything. Hopeless
NEVER do @SkyUK invite a friend!!! As soon As it's all through there is an 'issue' so they can't dispatch the cards.. convenient. #scam
And the whole series has today been added to @SkyUK Box Sets and @NOWTV - hooray! #SaveTheHalcyon Fancy commissioning series 2 now, Sky? :P
@SkyUK you guys are the worst customer service ever. Never had so much trouble getting rid of a service. What a group of gangsters.

Thank you @SkyUK for your great over the phone customer service!!

@SkyUK my broadband connection keeps dropping in and out. In Manchester. 😡. Can we fix this please?
My battles with @virginmedia over poor service are now thankfully a thing of the past. There is NO comparison with @SkyUK who are superb.
@imadamsavage @GinxTV @SkyUK @YouTube @AmhRichardson ** q and a session **
@tzb @Tweet_Cassandra @SheyMouse yeah @SkyUK
@imadamsavage @GinxTV @SkyUK @YouTube loved it how about a live first hour q and session on the sofa? I know @AmhRichardson  liked the idea
@matboyd @SheyMouse @tzb @SkyUK All fair enough! Although I always think not responding is rude, esp if you've saved from bigger issue
@SkyUK laptop to fix it, fuck that.
@SkyUK very unhelpful with my broadband problem. Told there's a fault on the line &amp; instead of sending an engineer to fix it told me buy a
Got a call from @SkyUK about changes I made to my account trying to talk me into extending a package I no longer need. Annoying and unwanted
@Tweet_Cassandra @SheyMouse @tzb example:back to the original tweet. @SkyUK have now fixed the cert, but not the site... no acknowledgment
@everydayloans why are you advertising loans at 79% APR on daytime TV, and why @SkyUK are you allowing greedy scumbags to do it, disgraceful
@SkyUK whats the dealio with sky go not working on any browsers now?
@SkyUK
Maybe I should report @skyUk to ofcom for making it difficult to switch to @virginmedia https://t.co/PXccLbNLyJ

Is there any way to be taken OFF @SkyUK mailing list? fed up of useless junk mail.

@SkyUK &amp; yes I did receive a letter but as I called after the 30 days. I'm expected to pay the cancellation fees @SkyUK I'm paying &amp; leaving
@SkyUK avoid them at all cost. They expect customers to be happy with a good deal, but not disappointed at overcharging them.... AVOID AVOID
@SkyUK then price increased. @SkyUK not one month have I had a bill for the same amount over the last 4 months, I don't have a house📞 soo???
@SkyUK I know I had a good deal, but if the offer Theres no need to remind me. My problem is that I had been overcharged, then credited....
@SkyUK you would rather lose a customer over £1.59 price increase rather than credit back the account amazes me....
