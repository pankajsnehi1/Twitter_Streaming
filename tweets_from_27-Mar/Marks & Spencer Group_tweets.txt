@marksandspencer kinda think the point has been missed. The bed is advertised as coming in 2bits &amp; staff confirmed this. Why?
Omg, @marksandspencer strawberries might be one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. Do they fill them with rainbows or something?
@marksandspencer I did wonder but when the water turned to sludge I guessed not! They look fine it's just that they won't last as long now.
@marksandspencer won't lie here guys... "saved the day" is a bit strong. Too much hassle for me &amp; sean. I'll be using @waitrose next time.

@marksandspencer hi, thanks but I have no receipt as it was a gift
@marksandspencer done
Also big shout out to @marksandspencer who completely failed to deliver the flowers the girls picked out for their mum for Mothers' Day.
Epic fail @marksandspencer despite the expensive ads you still couldn't deliver my mum's flowers on Mother's Day. Upset mum. Upset daughter
@marksandspencer terrible service from #m&amp;sflowers £80 spent, no flowers received after being 'despatched' 3 days ago 'Unhappy' Mother's Day
@marksandspencer tying to get hold of someone to make a complaint as i am un happy and cant get hold of someone
@marksandspencer @mark_hobley not spoken to anyone had email saying £10 off each.  Not good enough as wanted delivered on sun not sat!!
@marksandspencer mothers' day flowers should have been delivered Saturday, 15 mins wait today on help line to complain. Feeling frustrated

@marksandspencer Morning! Your store on Ipswich Rd Colchester has mixed up offer labels, v confusing incorrect pricing.Staff not interested
@marksandspencer really unimpressed and upset with the lack of quality of all your Mother’s Day flowers I sent this year. Not what I expect.

@marksandspencer The flowers for Mothers Day never turned up. The DPD driver sat at the bottom of my mothers drive and just drove off!
@YodelOnline There is no point. @marksandspencer have already looked into it. The reality is that Mums flowers are being delivered today!
@marksandspencer find the flower! Nope me neither! @standardnews
@marksandspencer Haha mine was awful https://t.co/ImwwaFexrg https://t.co/MaRH6aU58r
@marksandspencer Safe to say I'm pretty steamed and contemplating a credit card charge back as still not recieved service I paid for.
Pleased to say that @marksandspencer have agreed to refund me for the undelivered flowers. CC @picturofBritain @MoneySavingExp
@marksandspencer I have to work all week, can't call in break when your wait times are 30 mins. What are you going to do about it?
@marksandspencer, screwed up my Mum's flower delivery and CS refuse to deal with my wife as my name on order. What. A. Joke.

@marksandspencer Flowers for my amazing mum were a no show on Mother's Day. I'm in bad books, PLEASE HELP (card no show but not your fault!)
I've got an addiction to hot crossed buns please take them away @marksandspencer
@marksandspencer as I was in S Africa on Mother's Day for work I trusted you to deliver flowers. They never arrived! Not impressed 😡😡😡

Outraged at the state of the flowers my mum received from @marksandspencer at the weekend. Not good enough.
@medgoode @marksandspencer I second that Matthew. I've never had a problem with @waitrose flowers and wish I'd used them instead.
