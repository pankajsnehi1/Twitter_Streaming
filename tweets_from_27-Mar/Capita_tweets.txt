@CapitaPlc @PensionsOmbuds  I was advised this would be done within a month... how much longer? Thx
@CapitaPlc @PensionsOmbuds I've waited 3 mths for my pension transfer to be complete. Still not done &amp; no update despite emails &amp; chasers
@CapitaPlc How long does it take to process a pensions transfer request? Sent mine 3 months ago, followed up with emails... still nothing!
