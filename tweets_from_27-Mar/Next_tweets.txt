@nextofficial I've finally been given a refund but it was a lot of hassle &amp; not what you'd expect.
@nextofficial boots I bought 3 mths ago sides starting coming away from sole, store manager says I have wide feets 😫
@nextofficial apart from stock what else do you offer customers if that makes sense?
Dear @nextofficial Please enter the modern age and allow people to pay when they order online, instead of forcing them to use a credit acct
@nextofficial thanks

@nextofficial very disappointed about the flowers I ordered for Mother's Day. Not many flowers and not in a good state. £30 not well spent.

@nextofficial really unhappy with the Mother's Day flowers that were delivered yesterday. Nothing like the picture, never again! 😟
@littlelovely87 @nextofficial such a shame because even after a refund, the day has gone and it's ruined. Especially as I'm an only child.
