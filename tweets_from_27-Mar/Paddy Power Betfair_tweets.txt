@soccerluke4 @paddypower yep - I would've got 20 odd pound from a £2 bet, it's daft, anything couldve happened in the last 10
@Smiggy @paddypower had ivory coast scored I would have won £90 from a £10 bet. So frustrating.
@paddypower surely since the Senegal game was abandoned tonight then I should have my stake refunded since the game was not completed
@davetheblue41 @paddypower @josacklund No Beads
@SaltmarshChris @paddypower a few hundred &amp; I'll definitely cash out 😂😂😂
@KickAssCantona @paddypower well hopefully you get a tempting offer
@SaltmarshChris @paddypower definitely pal because I'm not too sure about Belgium tbh
@SaltmarshChris @paddypower nearly there &amp; they decide to get rid of the cash out https://t.co/Mkxahzeo6F
@KickAssCantona @paddypower all the rest of the games are tomorrow, so if I was you I'd check again in the morning
@paddypower is this correct...? Ivory coast game was abandoned https://t.co/roztTvUJSz

@Mattysthrlfc @paddypower was on about this in KFC😂 MLS is genuinely the worst
@KickAssCantona @paddypower when was the Nigeria match supposed to be.
@SaltmarshChris @paddypower that's the thing pal there's not even a cash out for the bet &amp; there usually is
@KickAssCantona @paddypower when I worked for coral, you could cash it in for less or wait for rearranged game to play and see what happens
@SaltmarshChris @paddypower I don't mind that once it's still going on
@KickAssCantona @paddypower you'll win less
