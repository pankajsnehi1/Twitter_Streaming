@AbiCapella @Ocado Oh totally, a basic food shop is @Morrisons all the way, but Waitrose have a heavenly range of butters!!
@EwanMitchell @Hopenlesmyth @Morrisons @Ocado all branded stuff apart from 6 cans of diet pop! Exactly the same trolley contents.
@Hopenlesmyth @AbiCapella @Morrisons @Ocado but is any of it #essential?
@Hopenlesmyth @Morrisons @Ocado it is crazy, only tried Ocado because £25 voucher and it isn’t even worth it with that!!!
@Morrisons Yes I should definitely do that if I go there this year! :)
Tested online shop with @Morrisons (£85.95) against @Ocado which was £112.83.
