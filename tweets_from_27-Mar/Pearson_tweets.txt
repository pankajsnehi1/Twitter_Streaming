@JennBinis @pearson they wanted unlikely which it is. It's unlikely for anyone to grow up to be President but why the need to include gender
@CHASE03670 I suspect they want "as likely as not" to be the correct answer. @pearson
@CHASE03670 Interesting. My hunch is they included it on purpose. That is, it's unlikely a girl grows up to be president. @pearson
Pearson PLC. did you really need to include the child's gender when writing this question? $PSO #genderequity‚Ä¶ https://t.co/VyCXC5fdns

@Y2Kotic @WaBATs_  Without gainful employment, many hopeless üò© youth end up in prison. @pearson @SmarterBalanced @Microsoft @BillGates
@Y2Kotic @WaBATs_ Thus high stakes testing is used to cull children from gainful employment. @pearson @SmarterBalanced @Microsoft @BillGates
@Y2Kotic @WaBATs_ So if kids can't grad HS, can't get GED, what kind of employment is there? @pearson @SmarterBalanced @Microsoft @BillGates
@Y2Kotic @WaBATs_ Year @pearson made GED harder, only 10% of # of kids passed yrb4, passed. @pearson @SmarterBalanced @Microsoft @BillGates
@Y2Kotic @WaBATs_  They are culled by denying them HS graduation. Then @Pearson made GED harder. @SmarterBalanced @Microsoft @BillGates
