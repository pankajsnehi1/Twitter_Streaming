I can always trust @IHG
@IHG trying to book with your European reservation hotline. Call always disconnects after trying to auto connect me with English service.
@IHG @ihgrewardsclub I don't appreciate the condescending attitude of your promotional personnel.

Terrible #customer service @IHG just because you prefer refunding points instead of cash. How long will it take? 4 months now? Keep the tip.
@Hi_Ex_Liverpool @IHG We look forward to having you stay! :-)

@AlexHennes @IHG - I'd check back or use services like hotel hustle.
