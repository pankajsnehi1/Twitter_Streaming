@ClairePotter @easyJet Compensation?
@BBCWatchdog appears to be a deliberate policy by @easyJet to prebook sports kit then claim too much luggage and not deliver it. 1/2
...and prioritising bikes over bags is ridiculous!!  Sort it out @easyJet a poor poor service
......given that all baggage has to be prebooked on surely you know whether there will be room in the hold @easyJet...?
@easyJet absolute joke of a service. Both outbound + inbound flights had none of our bags arriving........
@easyJet in fairness, he did catch up. Most of delay due to latecomers, not airline. If not for them we'd have been away on time. Thanks!

@easyJet Trying to book MAN to AMS, AMS to SXF, SXF to CPH, CPH to MAN for 2 adults, 1 child and 1 infant and it keeps crashing üò≠üò≠ Helpppp!
@marklamming @liveshq no, it really was me! With a bit of help from @easyJet
@easyJet now it's a 30 minute wait as we have missed another air traffic control slot‚Ä¶ https://t.co/FMttLCc4ZW
@easyJet over an hour sat waiting on the plane and just told another half hour to wait. No drinks or anything offered #shocking.

I want my money back üò°üò§ and I'll boycott until I get it ü§ó @easyjet #LYINGAIRLINE
@easyJet do you have any restrictions on travelling with a drone through @ManchesterAirp?
@easyJet sent you guys an email on 7th March.  Had an automated one back saying I'd be contacted within 7-10 days. Any ideas?
@easyJet still sat waiting. First it was waiting for bags, now it's the fog. #whatexcusenext
@easyJet , ref ezy8323 to CDG, guessing delaying opening gate and discussion of plane replacement mean we will be delayed. Can you help?
Had to delete a tweet about @easyJet on thurs due to offensive language.And here I sit again, delayed, again, trying very hard not to swearüòÅ

@easyJet 40 minutes sat on the plane and not moving at Bristol airport when we should be on our way to Alicante #frustrated
@The_Josiekitten @easyJet no clue. We were kept standing on stairs as pilot wasn't ready. Now boarding so might not be too late... ü§û
@sacks_jo @easyJet oh no, how long is the delay?
When you are travelling somewhere for 48 hours, it's always helpful if the flight is on time... ah well, never mind @easyJet

To the man in seat 15C on EZY6924, thank you for making sure I was ok. A kind stranger and a gentleman üëç@easyJet  #scottishandfriendly
Hey @easyjet I sent a claim for expenses on 6/3, promised a reply within 7 days..it's 12 days now - no sign of a reply. What's happening?
@scouser_andy @easyJet sort it or we all won't travel with you anymore
Not impressed with @easyJet lying to me as to why a flight was 5hrs delayed. I have a video rec of the crew telling us. cc @easyJet_press
