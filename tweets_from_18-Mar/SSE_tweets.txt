As an @SSE pay as you go customer, they're cutting not increasing charges - they estimate I will spend ¬£34.20 less‚Ä¶ https://t.co/14LFqNm1uX
@skyblue66 @paullewismoney @SSE Still ¬£20k a year cheaper than EON.
@paullewismoney @SSE better call it an UNSmart Meter. #whyIwontbegettingone
@paullewismoney @SSE I just didn't plug mine in!
@paullewismoney @SSE All part of agenda 21 and agenda 2030 plan by the UN.
@paullewismoney @SSE And that's why I won't have one. Much rather read meter myself.
@paullewismoney @SSE not sure how smart this metering is. Hope the hardware records use better than software reporting it.
@paullewismoney @SSE Good reason not to go with SSE üòï
@paullewismoney @SSE Not far wrong! Had notification of price rise from SSE last week. Projected ¬£100 increase on ¬£400 bill :-o
Smart meter so clever it immediately reacts when @SSE announces price rise. https://t.co/iNyWfZNkzs
@CFC_CommTrust @SSE definitely booking my daughter a place, she'll love it! @clarkeyblue El wants to go :)

@SSE Your service is shocking week without heat/hot water &amp; you don't turn up for scheduled app. I had to chase to be told your not coming
#thankyou @SSE for letting me know about the 10.7% rise coming to my bill 
Will look out for your profit announcement
@SSE have raised the electricity bill by nearly 20%. Are you having a laugh. Time to shop around.
Any idea when this issue is getting fixed @SSE ? Been going on for a couple of weeks now. https://t.co/NwyncdDkP3
@SSE 2 also, put meter readings into online account and it's not been updated either. Tired of sitting on hold. Could someone contact me pls
@SSE 1 - you've managed to send me an letter about price increase, but still waiting on up to date bill from meter reading on 7th march
@SSE offer such amazing tarrifs I just can't decide, any suggestions? https://t.co/EomWeyKvzE

We recently supplied this @engcon_  ec-oil tiltrotator and hammer package, read about it here‚Ä¶ https://t.co/9LtXXWjBpn
@spstoney It will be for some people as @SSE is forced by Ofgem to use 'typical' consumption by duel fuel customers. Highly misleading.
@SSE increase is 22% not 6.9% as stated in article https://t.co/X7uxV2RGaj
