@nextofficial low stock but no indication until purchase. Poor technology #nextsale
@nextofficial dissatisfied and disappointed long term customer #nextsale
@nextofficial online sale was awful. Basket picked with stocked items only to be sold out at check out. No reserve.

@nextofficial How do I stop you sending me directories I've not asked for? It's a massive waste of resource and goes straight in recycling.
@nextofficial ....customer service!!! It's an utter disgrace!
@nextofficial ...the priority for all the million staff in that shop was how quickly they could get the sale stock out - not the ...
@nextofficial ....outside shop and down the mall to the public toilets! I am absolutely disgusted!! Not what I would expect from this brand!

@nextofficial it was Wakefield Trinity. I am so hurt and upset by the lack of sensitivity, care and general customer service received!

@nextofficial @PaulinLondon7 the lady was a loss prevention officer even though there were general managers nearby saying nothing.
I'm pooped. Been to the @nextofficial sale, zoomies at Harlow park then saw off an ornamental dog in the antique shop window # knackered 😴
@nextofficial Marrakesh reed diffuser has done this to my window sill this morning 😔😠👍🏼 https://t.co/lTkk8o0WSi
@PaulinLondon7 @nextofficial yes totally
@nextofficial it was the Manchester Arndale store. The lady said it would stop people buying the sofa. Her attitude was very rude.
@tlew76 @nextofficial That's certainly no way to deal with customers! They've lost any potential purchases from you, I'm sure.
In other news, I've purchased a schnauzer print cushion from @nextofficial .
Today has been a good day.
Being told rudely by a store person to get off a sofa on sale in @nextofficial

@nextofficial hi they were a gift bought around April last year
@nextofficial can I make a suggestion - you incorporate an alert system to customers when the item they want is available.
@nextofficial 😒
So I get a email say the @nextofficial sale is on, yet everything I've just brought was all new in 😂😂 oh well #holidaysorted
Cant believe I'm missing @nextofficial SALE. Someone takeover work for me please!!

Dammit @nextofficial - restricting passwords to 12 characters is not good security.
@nextofficial your buyer's clearly got the quantities all wrong.
Surely you have contingency to have further popular stock replenished?
Crikey @nextofficial - another Sale?! 
You barely had any 'New In' stock when I looked last night never mind trying to shift the old stuff
@nextofficial hi thanks for the quick reply. No worries il wait until Tuesday Xx
