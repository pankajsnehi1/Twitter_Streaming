@SkyUK, two questions. 1) When will I be able to claim my free TV - it isn't there yet. 2) When can I get fibre, sales guy said 1-2 months.
@SkyUK my internet connection is so say super fast... I can't even see animated gifs! #betterwithdialup #whypayallthismoney
I can not believe that Internet Explorer (yes, internet bloody explorer) is the only compatible browser for Sky Go atm. 
@SkyUK fix it!
Really enjoying #TheWalkingDead S3. David Morrissey as The Governor is evil. Great writing &amp; fab action @AMC_TV… https://t.co/8vxHqYAaNJ
@SkyUK I will be turning off all channels tomorrow as your customer service is absolutely shocking....
No matter how much I pay for "better internet", @SkyUK always manages to make it seem like I'm downloading using bamboo or some shit.
@davidwalliams @SkyUK  The kids will love it!!
@SkyUK Fuck Sky Go. Doesn't work on any browser apart from Internet explorer which runs mad slow. Sort this shit out
@SkyUK what's going on tonight? Sort the broadband out.... £90 per month says it all

Happiness is life without @SkyUK TV - they are actually making me richer day by day
Don't know why I pay for #skymoviecinema what a load shit that's on @SkyUK please put something decent on ffs !! #wasteofmoney
@SkyUK can't believe sky refused a refund after cutting my phone line 3 weeks before end of contract. No wifi/phone Just £. @ConsumerRights

@skybrasil @SkyUK
@SkyUK miss sold Sky Q as told I could use my BT subscription to watch across other boxes , not true and unacceptable .
@SkyUK why does our broadband cut out all the time #annoying #sortitout

Left @SkyUK after 5 years! Moved to Virgin for half the price for the same package. I'll be back in a year to collect my TV as anew customer
Hey @SkyUK your attempt to fix my broadband has been pathetic. Think I'll be going elsewhere.
@SkyUK what is the point of having a broadband switch if it doesn't work online ?
Might as well stay with bt!!
It's appears that my definition of "No extra cost" differs from that of @SkyUK #SkyQ @SkyHelpTeam https://t.co/Db8kV8Tb8r

@SkyUK in ireland. Terrible signal. What can i do? https://t.co/acG0mLUUTX
@SkyUK - really poor service. 3rd outage is as many months. Very helpful team, but broadband service just not good enough. Disappointed.
@davidwalliams @SkyUK I was an extra
@SkyUK Just tried to get through to your broadband help, got told to call back between 10-6 on saturdays. It's 17:50...?
@SkyUK Hi Sky! What hoops do I have to go through to speak to a human being who works for Sky? Your automated line is frustrating me!
@virginmedia In case your wondering "why doesn't this morning tw*t go back to @SkyUK" I'm stuck with you until September unless I pay £250
@SkyUK 15 years a customer. Cancelled contract today. Customer service appalling. You don't deserve to stay in business
@SkyUK and the box will randomly delete your recording. I have no intention of paying for this lack of service. #Getfucked #wasteofmoney
@virginmedia Did you get my feedback about the inept training and/or deliberate ms-selling at your Bradford store?… https://t.co/eZ8NNrUCaC
@SkyUK pathetic. I've never seen a slower or less reliable broadband connection than this shite. 1MB per second through brand new ethernet.
@SkyUK is just shit. No good movies. No good sports. Get charged far too often as and when they please and its usually 2x the quoted price.
@virginmedia I Don't know if @SkyUK ignore complaints as I never had to complain shame work would only pay for Virgin
@SkyUK you've cut my service because I wont pay 2x my agreed fee 2 weeks after I last paid you? What happened to pay monthly #brokencontract
So @SkyUK rolled out a patch to @NOWTV boxes to prevent them sideloading Plex. Enjoyed the service but it's now completely useless!

Many thanks to @SkyUK for allowing me to change my plans for the weekend  and make me wait for an engineer that didn't arrive

@SkyUK looking the best bet. Cheaper, more channels &amp; 1TB SkyQ box (twice the 500GB @virginmedia are offering with the TiVo)
When you get lured to @virginmedia and cancel @SkyUK , wait a month and on the day of installation get a call to say yr area isnt connected
@ScouseMarkie @cash_converters @SkyUK That would be right.
@SkyUK Skygo player not working on Mac. Any chance you can bring back the web player?

@BTCare I've had BT fibre for over a month &amp; problems after problems with connectivity. Was with @skyuk for 3+ years and had no problems!
@SkyUK SICK TO DEATH OF HORRIBLE, SLOW INTERNET SPEEDS. POOR.
I've already wasted 2days off work waiting for @SkyUK to come fit tv been going on for over 3weeks now. Very unhappy with the service
I wish @SkyUK would stop calling me... been asked to be taken off their list serval times but they still call daily. Leave me alone ✋🏼
@MrsCupcake79 @almurray @SkyUK 
Not very good for people who don't like football!
Still no sign of @SkyUK , this is the third time I've had to wait in to see if they will actually bother to come and install tv.
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK please can you tell me when the 2nd half of Suits season 6 is on, as didn't realise it stopped for a season break!
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK thats the new box isnt it claire how long have you had it for? Xx
Would be a good gesture if @SkyUK provided Sky Sports in hospital patient lounges.
Football does just look glorious in #skyQ 4k! good work @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK
Currently at screaming pitch FRUSTRATION with @SkyUK automated customer services - an oxymoron. Only need to change e mail address!!! AARGH!
Why on earth is @ITV #HD Ch.178 on @SkyUK when ITV2/3/4 are 118/119/120 &amp; 117 is unused? #ITV #HD should be 117 FFS, the #tv guide's a mess!
@SkyUK @SkySports why does the bill go up annually but there is no champions league or 3 O'clock kick offs?
Gotta say - really unhappy with @SkyUK 2day. Rented #Ghostbusters on #Skystore recently £££. Yet 2day it's free on #SkyCinema 😢 #RIPOFF
@SkyUK can never get through on the phone, live chat is always busy, email the CEO Jeremy Darroch and still not got a response, not good Sky

@SkyUK why does your Sky Go app require access to my phone calls etc...? It doesn't make any sense. Please provide an explanation...
So sick of being a @SkyUK customer and their inconsistent bills... Absolutely ridiculous!

@TobyEgelnick @SkyUK @virginmedia that's a shame love virgin business broadband
@SkyUK  is there anyone at sky who actually knows how to give good customer service??
Sometimes wonder why we have @SkyUK at all. Seems lately every time I switch the box on there isn't actually anything decent to watch.
Anyone thinking of switching from @SkyUK to @virginmedia DON'T. 

Virgin inferior product. 

No tv after instal &amp; now no internet for days.
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK same issue here🙄🙄
The biggest deal of James Murdoch's lifetime - Fox taking over @SkyUK - thrown into jeopardy by his father,, @FoxNews CEO Rupert Murdoch.
@LeilaBekhti @mansmarlind @BjrnStein @SkyUK please say there is a 2nd series 🙏🏻
When you can't sleep and @SkyUK isn't working due to the "severe weather"😐🤔
@BTCare @SkyUK can you offer a better service? #poorservice
@TheMurdochTimes @Ofcom @SkyUK More proof that the Murdoch organisation isn't fit to own a toothpick let alone increase their monopoly
Top people mentioned in my Twitter feed: @ofcom, @skyuk, @gop ... You can check yours at https://t.co/6lxfzs6FR8.
If James Murdoch can ram through Fox takeover of @SkyUK, while Trump is blaming Fox for feeding him internationally damaging false claims...
@TheMurdochTimes @Ofcom @SkyUK Something fox news is begging Donald Trump to stop mentioning
.@Ofcom, you're going to sign off on Fox takeover of @SkyUK, while Fox caught up in international incident re Trump wiretap claims? REALLY?
@SkyUK @youview 2 recent episodes of Supergirl stopped recording at ~48min eg 7Sept 2x14 R you aware of this. Will there be a fix for future

Just about to sign up to @SkyUK and they get rid of the tv offer 👎🏼👎🏼😒 #skyorvirgin #choices @virginmedia
That Rupert is even CEO of @FoxNews today is another billboard to @21CF CEO James Murdoch's incompetency. Give him full control of @SkyUK?
