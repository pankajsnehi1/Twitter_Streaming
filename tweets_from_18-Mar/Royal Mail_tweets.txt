@RoyalMail Hello! I have a question about a package sent from the UK to Bulgaria. How can I contact you for more information?
@superdrughelp my oder 68440499 Track &amp; Trace @RoyalMail states it has been delivered on Wednesday - but it hasn't! Please can you help?!
absolutely fuming with @RoyalMail 😡😤someone best respond to this tweet
@RoyalMail I've just been scammed can you intercept my parcel?
Got to love @RoyalMail. 8pm on a Saturday and someone drops an out card through the door after making zero attempt to knock or ring
Okay it's 8 pm... calling it, @royalmail not coming. I wish they'd have let me know instead of promising &amp; not (literally...) delivering :(
@RoyalMail Hello? Still not replying to me, not even after a follow and a DM?
@RoyalMail JA415764938GB is saying Mis-Sort Scan at Delivery Office re-direct. Could you message me, the post code was incorrect
@Michi_Mij @RoyalMail - the universal service is a wonderful thing for us Rural types.
@RoyalMail Hi, I figured they're not coming. Normal mail showed up. Since not my fault can I ask for Monday delivery to go to a safe place?
@Michi_Mij @RoyalMail - particularly out in the sticks and Highlands.
@Michi_Mij - 24 hours from Dorset to you, @RoyalMail really is bloody good.
This is why dog owners create such a fuss (especially with @RoyalMail) about closing garden gates!! Hope you find h… https://t.co/yccBYikS6x
@TimWeaverBooks @RoyalMail from this day forth I shall be addressing all letters in this way 😆 https://t.co/iOZqt6fVfO
@RoyalMail Hi, it has been 7 days since my item was delivered, and no signature has come through "/ https://t.co/3Fw8isRjli
@RoyalMail I asked (and had email confirmation of) two parcel redeliveries for today from a Something For You card. Are they still coming?
The other side of the box - @USPS @RoyalMail @ctshirts https://t.co/E9Rve0WirQ

@RoyalMail setting up redirection with civil part kept own names but charged per person, discrimination surely, parents done same 1 charge
@RoyalMail Is it possible to send a battery-powered phone that does not come out like an iPhone with international shipment?
You'd think @RoyalMail would have gotten the message by now; when you try and pull that "import charge" shit with me, it never ends well...
@TimWeaverBooks @RoyalMail That is beautiful. A job well done. :')
@Moto_Support @RoyalMail Looking forward to it! Can you confirm that address is correct? Having an unreachable complaint box is pure genius!
@RoyalMail hey! I ordered a redelivery of an item 8 days ago for today which didn't come. Not cool!
Really don't like @RoyalMail - Waiting for a package sent on 9 March 2nd class signed for should take 1-3 days - useless &amp; unreliable!
@TiaanFaith @RoyalMail you visit from time to time and bring double deckers, I'm SOL if I want a package.
@RoyalMail. Got this in my letter box. No parcel inside gate. Reverse side is blank. Please help https://t.co/bLRZdcGTU1

@RoyalMail @ParceIForceUK disappointed to find parcel posted Wed am on Express48 is STILL is Derry depot.. delivery in 48hr? 79 &amp; counting

You know what I miss most about the UK. The @RoyalMail .. When are you planning to invade?
@RoyalMail I've been trying to pay a customs charge for 18 days. The website is finally working and now I'm getting an error? Can you help?
@RoyalMail it's amazing the amount of stuff that goes missing with you guys!
@RoyalMail -thanks for the phone update. Can you confirm when the parcel was returned to sender an also when will I be refunded charges ?
@RoyalMail I'm tying to arrange a redelivery but your website doesn't recognise the reference written on the card. Can you help?
@RoyalMail Three in Telford all different hours, not customer freindly
@RoyalMail Why do delivery offices have different hours, mine held at one that 9am to 1pm, my nearest is open from 6am no parcel for a week?
@RoyalMail I sent an item tracked on the 07/03 it's still it showing as delivered
I was guaranteed delivery today. Waited in all day, no postman. What gives @RoyalMail ?
@Moto_Support @RoyalMail 2 times got mail to "Motorola Mobility Contact Centre PO Box 3000 Edinburgh" returned. Is that a valid address?
@RoyalMail Why can't SE26 post be moved back to Sydenham office from Forest Hill?
@RoyalMail yep 4 days no mail. My new credit card 8 days since it was sent. #disgusting
@RoyalMail Why don't you do something about Forest Hill office, they don't even pick up to your escalation team? Customers have no chance
@RoyalMail Please tell me how someone working 9-5 weekdays is meant to get a delivery when the local office never delivers Saturdays?
@RoyalMail isn't it illegal to open letters what don't belong to you
@RoyalMail Why can't I contact anyone to speak to at 3pm on a Saturday?
@RoyalMail I posted a tracked &amp; signed for item on the 10/03 not showing as delivered. It's been a week
@RoyalMail ok guess your not going to answer me why would one of your employees would open letters
@RoyalMail Why are my redelivery requests continually ignored by my local sorting office in Forest Hill?
Thanks @RoyalMail for removing the tag that appeared last weekend #lovewhereyoulive #Camberwell https://t.co/OH8qpDCEu3

@DrSaraPayneMBE @ShyKeenan @RoyalMail I didn't know could still send gifts to that address. Thought was just letters
@DrSaraPayneMBE @ShyKeenan @RoyalMail oh no. Hope it gets sorted soon. Wrong timing. Not that there's ever a right time
Sorry to everyone at @SinkThePinkLDN tonight, but now I'll be a shit Barbie because @RoyalMail didn't deliver my hair extensions in time :(
@hayleyminn @RoyalMail 'that time I was robbed'
@PostOrifice @CllrHoffy very confusing! @PostOffice normally redirect my complaints via @RoyalMail response usually replied #wasteoftime
@RoyalMail can someone help me with this please?
@RoyalMail how long should I expect a letter to be at hwdc Langley arriving from Czech? It's been with them  2 weeks now.
.@RoyalMail hi, I submitted the online form 5 days ago, still no reply
I love my Bowie stamp print so much! Thanks @RoyalMail #BowieStamp #Royalmail https://t.co/hzzfCcxNib
@RoyalMail AND they haven't left a card or attempted to deliver to neigh even though they were in. AND I left a note on the door. Gutted! 😡
@RoyalMail Just a thanks to the team for getting my claim done so quickly, much appreciated :)
.@RoyalMail have royally fucked up my life again. Standard.
@RoyalMail Fuming.important b'day present 'attempted delivery' time when I was actually in!Now my boys have no present for their daddy 2moro
Seems to me fundamentalist islamists are just as likely to use @royalmail as anyone else, so why not advertise beside their Youtube videos?
@RoyalMail I've had outgoing mail in here since Tuesday which people are waiting on. It's now affecting my business!
@RoyalMail I wish to complain now, please don't tell me your twitter account is pointless too? https://t.co/Bxaq7nctyo
@RoyalMail we have on our phone "available for collection- retention" we cannot wait till Monday it is a birthday present for this weekend!
@RoyalMail it should have been delivered to student accommodation, stating "it was delivered at 08:10" it wasn't and we need this parcel!!!
@RoyalMail not happy with your service my girlfriend went to collect her parcel from the Huddersfield office and was unable to collect!!
@DPD_UK 2hours late and waiting.... think ill use @RoyalMail next time lol
.@ShyKeenan @RoyalMail What is more, we are currently fund raising for our Phoenix work, this is not the time to be messing with our post!?
.@DrSaraPayneMBE @RoyalMail ..wait what now! Yes RM ..please answer that question quickly ..what else are we not receiving AGAIN?
@RoyalMail Are special delivery's still by 1pm on a Sat?
@RoyalMail may?! The attitude of the staff member who blamed it on the company who sent the package! The goods were damaged.
.@RoyalMail ..hello RM, one of our #PhoenixFriends is trying to send our Org a gift and is being told our PO Box doesn't exist? CO20YB Why?
@royalmail They're beautiful. https://t.co/zEvJOxgZBd
@RoyalMail Waiting 4 a redelivery scheduled for today. Postman has been and gone-no sign of my parcel. Any idea why it's not been delivered?
Is this really an acceptable way to post mail?!? @RoyalMail https://t.co/mfEsrcrO4A
@RoyalMail also amused that for the first time in two weeks, postie was spotted collecting the day after my tweet.
FFS @RoyalMail asked for parcels to go in blue bin,so postie sticks a card thru to collect at sorting office!!! 😡😡😡😡
@RoyalMail emptied daily? Don't think so, it was posted last Saturday, it arrived today. It's taken a week to travel 30 miles.
Bit of an F-you to anyone needing to pick up a parcel isn't it @RoyalMail? https://t.co/My5Mbr4T0n
@RoyalMail I don't know who signed for my package today but it wasn't me &amp; I've been in all day. Not happy they didn't ring my doorbell 😠

@RoyalMail This still hasn't been sorted as of 1pm today! What's going on!!! https://t.co/323S4xqr28
@RoyalMail had a tracked item delivered by you-says delivered but I didnt receive. Is there someone i can talk to to find out what happened?
@RoyalMail this van has just cut us up on a roundabout nearly causing a serious accident 😡 https://t.co/DxiRF3HDTI
@RoyalMail "delivered"??? Good job it wasn't stolen. Also it would have easily fit through the letterbox 😡 https://t.co/ecGHXcX7DL
Will never be posting anything with @RoyalMail again they are lazy. And can't deliver on time when they charge over the rate. Awful service
I've never had these @RoyalMail delivery emails before.
Somewhat mixed messages so far... https://t.co/3kqKFxkwrk
@RoyalMail I've only received part of my order 1213689 dated 25 Jan. I've got the Bowie stamp set but not the Pink Floyd one. Please advise.

@RoyalMail I have literally just been sat in my living room and the postman has put a card through the door without even knocking!! FUMING

@RoyalMail received something for you card I've been in all day postman did not try the door not good enough
Love the @RoyalMail postman who must have had the touch of an angel. 'Knocked whilst I was out' my arse!
@RoyalMail hi. Was charged £11.70 to post parcel special delivery. Is there a reason recipient was charged an extra 39p to pick it up?
@royalmail @parcelforce I think I paid a customs charge to RM, where it was required by PF, RM took my money and I have no PF ref# plzhalp
@RoyalMail how does it make sense to need the persons ID and not just same address to pick up parcel? Surely its more possible for fraud
@RoyalMail disgraceful service a package has been returned to me empty with the call centre down for maintenance
@RoyalMail if I design my own Royal Mail uniform could I use it in my student film production this year? 😇
@RoyalMail and the tracking says its gone back to Pontefract? Wtf
@RoyalMail why have 4 letters from Liverpool since February failed to turn up. Losing one is fine but 4 is unforgivable.
@Fu22yFelt You'll need to check this with @royalmail as they deliver the mail. - Jess
@RoyalMail   Well done. Managed to lose 1st class letter to same address still, as long as your CEO gets his pension # yummy mummy

@RoyalMail how do I set up the safe place option?
@RoyalMail my parcel on tracking is taking longer than usual to get to its destination. How do I know where it is and if it's not lost?
@TimWeaverBooks @RoyalMail this is my favourite thing ever! I was so happy when I saw this arrive in the office!

@WaltonBob @postboxcollect @RoyalMail @PeasholmPark made by Andrew Handyside in my home town of Derby! 😍
@squarewheels_ @postboxcollect Too close to bus stop to be safely emptied?  How many boxes in such places are now doomed @RoyalMail ?
@RoyalMail Wasn't you? It was Royal Mail who damaged it, that was my point in including you.
@RoyalMail my parcel was returned to sender with no attempt at delivery... not happy!
Once again shocking delivery service from @RoyalMail over 10 days after its been despatched I still have no goods?? #notroyal #crapservice
@RoyalMail thanks for the clarification. We have contacted the sender, but they ask us to follow up with Royal Mail, therefore here we are.
@RoyalMail not the best service, my package has been lost for a month and a half and doesn't help the sender not replying
@RoyalMail is there any way I can get my parcel sent to a closer post office? I have no idea where the one on the form even is 😭
@RoyalMail continually told that my postcode from my customs charge doesn't exist online and the post office my parcel is at is ages away!
