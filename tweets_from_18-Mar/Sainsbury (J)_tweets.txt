@sainsburys it's here now. #paninigate is over
@FredOfWoodGreen @sainsburys @GiselaStuart I don't know what she's got to do with it?
@sainsburys I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with it, it‚Äôs just not very nice. The quality is poor. Thin sauce, excessively salty
@sainsburys I'm waiting in the cafe for a panini to be toasted 15 minutes so far
@sainsburys their H&amp;S training, cages/cardboard everywhere...&amp; kept blocking the toilet door with a cage despite the toilets being in use
@semiruralspock @sainsburys I blame @GiselaStuart üòê

Mess outside Beckenham @sainsburys . Could they not clean outside? Community spirit lacking? @beckenham_forum https://t.co/0wYyLFvdcX
#SupermarketsIntheNews @Sainsburys  @Tesco penalise their customers with price hike for delivery, which should be no more than ¬£3 #Noexcuses
I wish  @sainsburys Beckenham would clean up litter outside. Members of Beckenham Appreciation group hate the mess

@sainsburys If a delivery fails, as mine did, why would u assume a customer would even want to use an e-voucher for another shop?
@sainsburys my delivery was missing ¬£33 of items - a whole crate! 'Delivery charge' 'refunded' only as e-voucher &amp; no compo? Useless!
