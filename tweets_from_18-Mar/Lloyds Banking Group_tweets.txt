@AskLloydsBank I've not spoken to Asda yet. They cancelled my order because your fraud team declined the transaction. I don't blame them!
@AskLloydsBank The Asda order was last amened at 8.42pm Fri night. Asda don't charge the card until after the shopping has been picked.
@AskLloydsBank The Asda food order would have been put through their till at 3.57am when the text message was send though!
@AskLloydsBank I did get a follow up message but I replied at 6.40am when I woke up.
@AskLloydsBank declining my food order at 3am because I wasn't awake to reply to this text message was not helpful,‚Ä¶ https://t.co/4g2fSt8JTM
