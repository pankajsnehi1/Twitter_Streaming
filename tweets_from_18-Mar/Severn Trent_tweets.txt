Hi @stwater @Derbyshirecc -have you considered long-term repair solutions? Save time/lives/resources… https://t.co/BHVIibnNOn
Delighted to see #potholes are being repaired @CorbridgeMr @stwater @Derbyshirecc but a quick fix is not the answer… https://t.co/bbTBZnPmG1
@stwater oh and buy the way is not the gully repair. It's a water main the building site damaged but didn't report. #repair
@stwater @DamianCarlin1 That's ridiculous. No cars park there it's an entrance to a building site. No wonder water bill is expensive.
@stwater @DamianCarlin1  105 Pilsley road danesmoor. Try s45 9bu is post office. That's nearly under water.
@stwater @mrpotholeuk @ikoplc It's a shame as this road was only fully resurfaced last year by @Derbyshirecc I will keep an eye out.
@stwater hiya, can you explain to me why my bill increased by £50 in a year?
@stwater @Derbyshirecc @mrpotholeuk @ikoplc thanks this has sunk and the damage in the immediate area needs repair.
@stwater water leak 105 Pilsley road s45 9ad# sort it out
@stwater 7 days atrium main still leaking. Reported 3 times to you but still leaking. # high bills# severn trent#ridiculous
Thanks @stwater for repairing leak Storrs Road Chesterfield but reinstatement of road is very poor @Derbyshirecc @mrpotholeuk @ikoplc
