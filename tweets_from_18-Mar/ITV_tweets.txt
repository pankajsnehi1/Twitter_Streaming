@ITV July 1987 saw the 1st episode of the very popular sitcom 'Watching'.  Any thoughts on a possible re-run to celebrate 30 years?
@UnderDogsLover @itvcorrie @ITV @WeAreSTV I'm getting a bit sick of the stupid storylines in all the soaps 😴
@pestononsunday @Peston @ITV @AlunCairns @RSAMatthew @NickyMorgan01 @SKinnock @themiltonjones same old europhile panel week after week
Old Westminsters Gavin Rossdale @thevoiceuk and Grace Chatto @cleanbandit both doing their thing live on @ITV
So @antanddec #SaturdayNightTakeaway isn't on @itvhub yet?! @ITV has the worst catch up tv of them all 🖓
All going to shreds for @ITV with lousy gags on The Nightly Show. Poor upcoming guests @GordonRamsay, please don't! https://t.co/cNuFBS3Bde

@kristyrose2 @ITV 😀yeah seems good ❤️
Loving #LethalWeapon on @ITV, it's just as fun as the movies, took a little getting used to but well worth watching.

Sunday morning chills even in Oz, catch tv @ITV #Broadchurch

@ITV can't believe that Lethal Wepon is only available to watch on iPad and not android or smart tv's! You might want to mention this!!
@pestononsunday @Peston @ITV Tell Sturgeon she's not getting a referendum because they can be trusted to run an honest campaign. #deficit

@thevoiceuk @ITV Put this back the on BBC and we can watch it in half the time! Bloody commercial breaks.....
@mariiellis @ITV fair enough .
@thevoiceuk @ITV @maxvickers Love him 😍
@thevoiceuk @ITV @RealSirTomJones @Intothearkmusic no surprise here, public please vite for Craig
The format just doesn't work once we get past the blind auditions! Also, the UK version seems slightly cheap despite @ITV #TheVoiceUK

@AnnCleeves @BrendaBlethyn @kennydoughty @ITV  Looking forward to when it airs in the US.
@thevoiceuk @ITV no surprise Tom picked the Welsh boys, I so hope you get through
Wooooo @Intothearkmusic #teamtom @thevoiceuk @ITV #tuneage 💕🎵
@afield70 @ITV I get that-just think it's the sort of thing that needs to change &amp; that has to start with what's placed in public conscience
Why does @ITV persist in showing movies in full screen pan and scan when others broadcast in widescreen #Terminator2
@JustAnotherCJ @antanddec @itvtakeaway @ITV @StephenMulhern I thought bf ment boyfriend 😂
Love you boys 😊💞📺 @antanddec @itvtakeaway @ITV #SaturdayNightTakeaway #AntAndDec https://t.co/tFkua5Jvlh

This years #thevoiceuk has been the best series so far @ITV
@antanddec your challenge with Phil and holly made lol do much I was crying😂😂😂😂😂😂 @itvtakeaway @ITV X
@hollywills @Schofe @ITV @antanddec shame it had to be cut short because of the rugby. So so funny. Can't believe only a few weeks left 😣
@ITV What day is it on on BBC America?  Can't find it!!  Can find on Netflix Season 1 and 2. But I've seen that.
The six nations is over :(
However @ITV coverage of the six nations is over too, so every cloud... #SixNationsRugby #sixnations

@itvtakeaway @ITV @WeAreSTV FLIPPING SPORT INTERFEARING WITH MY PROGRAMMES...
@edwardgvickers @ITV @itvtakeaway I suppose it was all decided last minute. They can do ticket giveaways and jewels next week extra
@samiaustin @ITV @antanddec What a load of garbage that was!
A bit conflicted - happy that rugby is getting more coverage on @ITV or miffed because it's cut off @itvtakeaway - argh!!!
@thevoiceuk @ITV wow smashed it 👌🏻 x
See enough TV. Need to leave time for books, cinema, friends, family, LIFE. No offence to @ITV or @antanddec. If you @adilray on I'd watch 😁

@ThinkBiafra @RoyalFamily @ITV yikes!
@ITV another blurry, hi - contrast mess for the rugby then... have you seen how @BBC do it?
Catch the first episode of Vera Series 7 tonight at 8pm on @ITV! Starring #NoofMcEwan, @steveevets26 and @kemi_bo! https://t.co/KP7qRcnyk7
@ITV the picture quality from the Ireland England match is dreadful. Who is the OB company?
If @ITV &amp; @BBCSport are to share @SixNationsRugby coverage, then timings must be scheduled better. #final #epicfail #rugby #6nations2017
@ITV commentators don't know the difference between OTOGE &amp; VINEPOLA
@ITV Your absolutely Useless ITVHUB doesnt work and asks a laptop browser (macbook) to purchase your shit app from the google play store...
Anyone know how the quarter finals of @ITV The Voice UK works? Im a first time voice watcher...thanks
@DanielSparkrite @ITVSport @ITV @itvhub HD on SKY &amp; freeview !!
Ok so @ITV didn't realise that the France v @wales_rugby would play 100 mins #missed first 5 mins #CmonIreland
This is gonna be a great show on @ITV in April #KeithandPaddy picture show just watched previews @MCMComicCon #MCMBirmingham @lemontwittor
@ITVSport @ITV @itvhub @SixNationsRugby but the coverage is so grainy and out of focus!!!
@alstewitn @ITV so agree that wasn't rugby at all, hope they find evidence of the biter
@BBC quality of the Six Nations compared to @ITV.. https://t.co/l2WGJBxQFR
Biased commentary already. Ireland knock = mistake, England knock on = nerves #IrevEng @ITV
And to make things worse #IREvENG is on @ITV 😡😡😡
@alstewitn @iainmartin1 @ITV Wales should have won this. France abusing the rules to get free replacement for 'head injury'.
@itv I definitely want to watch 3 adverts in a row from your web player when the shitting rugby is on live.
@alstewitn @ITV couldn't agree more. Painful to watch the end of that match.
@ITVSport @ITV @itvhub can't you this in HD?
@alstewitn @ITV Thank you for your extended commentary Alastair. Never mind F1 back next weekend 🏁
@BBCSport @brianmoore666 and now switching over to @ITV  for the rugby, its like going from a fine Malbec to meths !
@alstewitn @iainmartin1 @ITV Barnes had a very poor game
20-18 and, frankly, ridiculous. @itv now.
@ITV  better postpone the @EnglandRugby game!!!!
@AnnCleeves @BrendaBlethyn @kennydoughty @ITV Love him back on Twitter.
@AnnCleeves @BrendaBlethyn @kennydoughty @ITV If you see Dougie in the near future, give him my love. All his followers are very fond of him
