@sainsburys frustrated with food on the go that was frozen rather than chilled! I know it's warm but no need for frozen carrots!

@nectar @sainsburys You keep giving me vouchers I can't use - and you know I can't use them!
@sainsburys it was a PlayStation 4 control. The box was there and it had a sticker saying "take me to the till" so it is something you sell!

Hey @sainsburys I'm looking at picking up a Nintendo switch today! Do any of your stores in/around Hertfordshire have any stock currently?
@sainsburys @tesco now that supermarkets take most of our food money, there's no incentive to provide traditional overnight bakery.
@sainsburys Nothing in this to explain how exact same item in same area costs 40% more at Sainsbury's vs @waitrose. You are cheating people.
@sainsburys @tesco Not blaming the stores. In my experience this is an issue with all supermarkets. It's company policy not to give a toss.
@Tesco Lunch deal with naked smoothie for £3 is the best thing ever. @sainsburys used to have the best before they destroyed it now Tesco.
