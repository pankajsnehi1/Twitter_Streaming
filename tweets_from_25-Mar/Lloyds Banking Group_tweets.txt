@n0rm @AskLloydsBank go with @monzo - current will be along soon, write your own app if you like (but theirs rocks)
@AskLloydsBank I can't call 0800 without being charged on my mobile tariff-any online forum I can discuss this over?
Hello, @AskLloydsBank I'm a lanyard collector with a very small collection, would you be able to help? Do you have any spare lanyards? üòÄ
@AskLloydsBank Hello can you tell me if two current accounts can be held by one person.  Thanks
@AskLloydsBank haven't had a working credit for one week.  Your customer service is disgusting as well #customerservice
@MrWNeedham @AskLloydsBank I'll take a look - ta
@n0rm @AskLloydsBank irrelevant. Get Bankivity
@AskLloydsBank done thank you
@AskLloydsBank thanks for the swift reply
@n0rm @asklloydsbank Santander is pretty reasonable. Downside is that for personal/Select you can only go back a year online.
@n0rm @AskLloydsBank @monzo soon‚Ä¶
@AskLloydsBank hi, hoping you can help. If I use the mortgage calculator will it go on my credit file history?
@AskLloydsBank yes, the person I spoke to has changed my dd date and will log a complaint on my behalf. She was very helpful.
@AskLloydsBank (thanks for responding though :)
@AskLloydsBank I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve given up and got my paper statements out
@AskLloydsBank search is terrible, calendar continually resets to today, complains about search ‚Äúover 3 months‚Äù when it isn‚Äôt, etc, etc!
@n0rm @AskLloydsBank think @natwest_help might be worth a look. App is excellent. Can keyword search the last 12 months statements.
@AskLloydsBank thanks MA. I've spoken to a nice person at lloyds who has sorted me out for now. That ruined my weekend though. Bad job.
Is there any bank with a good statement search/download online? I‚Äôm sick to death of @AskLloydsBank - it‚Äôs terrible. Suggestions welcome.

@AskLloydsBank credit card has just screwed me over royally by not changing the date of my dd to after pay day as requested. Shonky.
@AskLloydsBank in the U.K, the pin was read fine, just kept declining and not letting me withdraw money
@AskLloydsBank debit, it declined on contactless and chip and pin, went to get money out and it wouldn't let me do that either
@AskLloydsBank my card is getting declined when I definitely have the money in my account, why??
@AskLloydsBank is it possible to open an account with just a British passport if you don't have a permanent address in the UK yet.
@AskLloydsBank Received this text. Don't think this is from you. Sadly can't see number, but thought you should know https://t.co/UolXSCYncu
@AskLloydsBank I believe so. But I'm wondering why you're taking the money 2 days from now? The 27th is in the future!
Quick reminder never use @AskLloydsBank  for your home insurance. They do not use qualified contractors by there own admission. üëå
@AskLloydsBank why are you taking future money???????!?!!!!?!! https://t.co/21HcFv9sfS

@AskLloydsBank if I'm not registered can I pop in a Llyods bank and transfer it manually ?
@AskLloydsBank hi , Possible to transfer Money from My Llyods to Tsb account ?
@AskLloydsBank Just a normal current account, which I've had for 11 years and I currently have a ¬£8000 loan with them and a savings account
@AskLloydsBank why can I not have contactless on my bank card
@AskLloydsBank #appalling customer service again from Lloyds. Still no letter after chasing all week and no one will action or call me!!!!!
@AskLloydsBank Will do that thankyou
@AskLloydsBank The Brighton and Hove branches. However, I can now only collect the letter from the Rushden (or any nearby) branch on Monday.
@AskLloydsBank Deleting and reinstalling didn't help
@AskLloydsBank Rushden, Northants. Went into the branch and was told someone would call me back yesterday.
@AskLloydsBank Ago even
@AskLloydsBank I tried 30 minutes ok
@AskLloydsBank ...and no one has. I have to have the letter by Monday or my husband will be denied his spousal visa and have to leave UK.
@AskLloydsBank ...fallen below a certain amount for six months. Been promised someone would call me to arrange from 3 different branches...
@AskLloydsBank The Home Office requires a letter from my bank stating the date my account was opened and confirmation that it hasn't...
@AskLloydsBank since app for online banking had an update I can no longer make. Transfer from iPad but can with iPhone. Why.
Waited weeks for required letter from @AskLloydsBank stating account info for husband's spouse visa. Have ONE day left to get it. @BritCits
@RaineMichaela @AskLloydsBank it's very tempting to do the same
@AskLloydsBank yes all apps are fine and browsing internet fine, can log on via safari to lloyds but not via app
@AskLloydsBank 2/2 would never have chosen the account if I knew it was a 60 mile round trip to get the letter for our bonus
@AskLloydsBank do you not think it would be helpful to PUBLICISE the fact that I need to go into branch to close HelptoBuyISA 1/2
@AskLloydsBank lloyds app says 'you are not connected to the internet' only happens on data, wifi is fine. Reinstalled etc nothing works
@AskLloydsBank hi, it's just a normal classic account. It has no money, or anything on that account as I've got a platinum and credit card.
@AskLloydsBank hi, I have three Lloyds accounts. I want to close one of them. Do I have to go into branch to close it, or can I call up?
@AskLloydsBank can you clarify something for me - I'm sure I don't have a bank account with you guys but received t‚Ä¶ https://t.co/pDWVftQVGh
