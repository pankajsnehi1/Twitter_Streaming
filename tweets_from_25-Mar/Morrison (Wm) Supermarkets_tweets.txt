@Morrisons Would you reccomend gift wrapping the chicken when presenting it to your Mother ?
We know that already @Morrisons but why up to 2p and not 2p? Must be profiteering. #Marketinghype

@Morrisons Okay. Does that apply for all of the products then? Also, what is the More card policy for adding forgotten receipts?
@Morrisons thanks Tabby, I know it's not your fault, just wish Morrison's. Would do something about it..

@Morrisons Got a ¬£1.50 coupon but the product is less than that. Can I still use it?

@bmc875 @Morrisons is cheese racist too? Is nothing sacred?
@LBofBexley @Morrisons anything the council can do to stop Morrison's shoppers leaving trolleys everywhere in sidcup high street? Coins?
@JBrokenshire @Morrisons I don't suppose there is anything govt can do to prevent Morrison's from blighting high street with its trolleys?
@Morrisons 9.03 am and people cannot get into the berwick hills store in middlesbrough because the door is locked https://t.co/PnIAKJKvFr
@Morrisons your trolleys are blighting the high street, only your trolleys! No other shops have this issue,
@Morrisons no social responsibility from Morrison's to stop people leaving shopping trolleys everywhere, some people have 0 common sense.
@Morrisons thank you üòä
