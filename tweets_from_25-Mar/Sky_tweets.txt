@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK Thank you. Can you advise is it resolved now?
I was gonna keep @SkyUK broadband after move but there's no way I'm having any of their products anymore. Dude you're 0/10 now.
So @SkyUK put you on the spot trying to make you raise your "rate" or justify it. Dude it's cos I'm still on the phone after saying thxbai.
Then spent ages on the phone after saying thanks to "rate" the guy I spoke to. Apparently 8/10 is too low for @SkyUK, it's "unresolved call"
@DannyPage77 @SkyUK @bt_uk Add to that a saving of ¬£25 through not paying for BT Sport too.
Called @SkyUK for help with satellite connection issue and they tried to sell me more TV packages. Dude I can't use the ones I have now.

I've got every practice session of @F1 recorded and your F1 report from AFTER qualifying. But not qualifying itself @SkyUK
@SimonPBatch I paid for SkyQ and a new TV just for F1, first time recording UHD and it failed. Not a happy bunny @skyuk
Thanks @Skyuk, SkyQ box crashed overnight so after months of waiting for @SkySportsF1 in UHD I have to watch highlights instead
Q boxes are fucking awful, @SkyUK what's the point in a series link when it doesn't recorded half the episodes?!
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK right In front of them, you get a not so clear picture if your viewing from the sides
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK @SamsungTV I wouldn't bother with a curve mate, just a gimmick and not good angles on them for viewing, ok just sitting
@matthewnunn1986 @SkyUK already have sky HD and view it on my 46". Still about a year away from committing to a new @SamsungTV 55" 4K curved
@SkyUK you should be ashamed ¬£18 for one extra bloody channel! Either that or let normal tv take sports back #pissedoff #f1starting
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK I think when things start getting specifically made for UHD more and more it will be worth changing, future proofing üëçüèª
@snappyfordy @SkyUK I don't have Sky as I'm poor but I can confirm that @FreeviewTV suffers the same issue!!!
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK yeah I've been looking to upgrade and it's only 42" and above where I'm really seeing the difference.
@PaniTsouris @NeilClarke84 @SkyUK the picture will be better than the picture you have already if you don't have UHD, it's 4x better than hd
Cheers @SkySportsF1 @SkyUK woke up to find qualifying not recorded but practice 3 is...
@SkyUK depois de seis anos vou cancelar a Sky ...
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK do you have Sky already?
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK to get the full benefit out of UHD you need a 55" or bigger but I have 49 and it's still very good, better than hd1080p
@TheDuffaloUK @SkyUK doubt it as there competitors
@NeilClarke84 @SkyUK Nice one Neil üëç.  My TV has a pretty epic picture tbh. Can't believe it can get any better which is why I'm curious
@SkyUK just signed up for #SkyQ and was looking at the apps will #Netflix or #Amazon be available in the future?
Not a great start to a new season of @SkySportsF1 partial record of Q3, complete fail on qualifying and why no repl‚Ä¶ https://t.co/jfmVIm24eM
@SkyUK so this is how F1 in UHD looks after recording this morning? Well at least I can watch on demand - or not. U‚Ä¶ https://t.co/AZPpRnKru3
@virginmedia I've been doing this since January 2016!!! Got me nowhere. @SkyUK give me a call!
@SkyUK why is your broadband so rubbish in the Old Leake, Lincolnshire area? ü§îüòì.
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK smaller TVs you will notice but not a massive need.
@PaniTsouris @SkyUK I've been told it depends on the size of the tv, large TVs you will really see the difference......
@SkyUK Hotly followed by a cancelled service
@SkyUK I really enjoy getting up and fannying about trying to get logged into skygo on 3 devices. Thanks for ruining F1 qually for me today
@SkyUK @F1 would love to watch the formula 1 BUT SKY GO IS NOT WORKING
@SkySportsF1 @SkyUK Cannot watch F1 on sky go which is really disapointing this needs to get fixed NOW its been broken for 2 days
@FoxyTeachingEd @SkySportsF1 @SkyUK how frustrating üò°
Does anyone hav @SkyUK #SkyQ? Do you notice a significant upscale with a 1080HD Tv or do you need a 4k to see the difference? Is it worth it
@SkyUK where's the wire box set gone? Didn't get to finish it #bringitback #thewire ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

@wobblethron @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK Not ideal, but you can use the link https://t.co/Dk0zhh98zo with your normal Sky Go login details.
@SkyUK Thanks for not recording qualifying on #skyf1 even though we have series link and every other session and race is scheduled
@CJ_Lowki @SkyUK so that's 5% of 2017 F1 season ruined already. Thanks sky

Lol @SkyUK is the only company the longer you're with them the shitter your deal gets. How do you get less for your money &amp; call it loyalty?
@gideoncresswell @SkyUK @SkySportsF1 I didn't get to see any of it, spent an hour just waiting for it to work ..
The absolute FURY of waking up to find after waiting 3 months for f1 to return. The @SkyUK box can't do its job üò≠üò°üò≠‚Ä¶ https://t.co/jXTLkJTEQQ

Is your app down @SkyUK ? I've been trying to connect to @SkyF1GP for the last 30 mins and get a code 9 error

Up early watch @SkySportsF1 but @SkyUK sky go player application for MacBook is failing. Pic stuttering despite other channels working fine
@AshDicko @SkySportsF1 @SkyUK I've accepted you must resort to piracy in 480p. Terrible yet better experience than Sky Go this morning!
The real question is: if a tree falls in the woods and the @SkyHelpTeam is not round to hear it, did it happen? #SkyGo #SkyF1 @SkyUK
@SkyUK why is @mtvex episode 10 not on sky go ?
@Mitchtrix @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK sorry ;)
@SkyUK PLEASE SORT OUT SKYGO SO I CAN WATCH QUALIFYING F1 #GUTTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT
@TalkTalk @SkyUK
@Ynys @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK I've had to find an alternative way to watch it not through sky, shocking!
Work up at 5.50am for @F1 #AusGP #qualifying and now I can't watch it because @SkyUK Sky Go isn't working üò©üò©üò©.........
@Ynys @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK show off :p
@Mitchtrix @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK I currently have it but every 5mins it crashes
@SkySportsF1 sky go is not working @SkyUK 3 months of promotion and you fail to show it! Pathetic #skygo
@Ynys @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK it's shocking. I have audio but no image. Not exactly what I woke up at 5:45am for!!
@Mitchtrix @SkyHelpTeam IE is our only option now, come on @SkyUK  fix it please
@SkyUK first #F1 race this season on @SkySportsF1 this isn't annoying at all! #SortItOut https://t.co/ODaS25D0ym
Has anyone filed a missing persons report for @SkyHelpTeam ? #SkyGo #SkyF1 @SkyUK
Excitement of the new F1 season and Sky Go won't work. Thanks a bunch @SkyUK. If you're going to rip us off, it REALLY helps if things work.
Not a fan of #F1 but I'm a huge fan of #SkyQ and #UHD and it's pretty damn impressive, the detail and quality is amazing! Well done @SkyUK

I would 100% not recommend anyone to become a customer of #SkyGo @SkyUK ! I've purchased magic beans that I've felt less regretful about.
And it's failed again. How much money does sky get from customers? Please put some towards improving the SkyGo aspect. @SkyUK
Oh you've got to be kidding me @SkyUK. I wake up at 5am to watch qualifying and SkyGo isn't even working. Absolutely fuming!
@SkyUK said that too soon come on Sky
@SkyUK  thank you, #SkyGo seems to be working, cutting it a bit close on the #F1 quali
Get up early to watch the F1. Guess what? @SkyUK not working. But it's ok, I'm recording it so I'll catch up. Nope,‚Ä¶ https://t.co/3aDkLnxtIt
Awesome, I woke at daft o'clock to watch the Grand Prix quali on Sky Go, and now it's no longer working (error 3050). @SkySportsF1 @SkyUK
I'm starting to like @SkyUK resetting cos the 'believe in better' slogan appears &amp; reminds me to check if @virginmedia is in my area yet.
Thanks @SkyUK for F***ing my night
@SkyUK Sort your damn website out.... it is stupid slow and now I am missing the F1 thanks to it... stayed up to 3am for this s***
Hey @SkyUK I realise you don't appreciate my hatred of your toxic boss...

I pay for internet.
It's not working
