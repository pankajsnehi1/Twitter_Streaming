@easyJet hello
60‚Ç¨ cheap airfare with @easyJet + 50‚Ç¨ taxi due to airplane 4hrs delays. This is low cost baby.
@easyJet that's not the point; if there are 2 travelling it shows on both passes and you have no idea how many bags are booked #notlogical
@easyJet Hi, is anyone available for a question? Thanks
@dove_lar @BritishAirwSUCK @British_Airways @easyJet @VirginAtlantic I am done with #britishairways.  Almost any carrier is now better

Me dice @easyJet al facturar que no puedo llevar catapultas en la maleta. Pues ya me ha jodido el viaje...
@easyJet why can I now not bring a hand luggage and laptop bag? Talk about squeezing us for everything possible!!
Sort it out @easyJet. 5 hour delay in Marrakesh is a joke.
@easyJet Flight EZY8894 from Marrakech to Gatwick is showing at 12 midday departure tomorrow. E-mail suggests otherwise, can you confirm?
#WillieWalsh comments on @easyJet &amp; @ryanair in 2013 &amp; now seems content on @British_Airways emulating them in 2017 https://t.co/vSY0W94dlo
@easyJet your app says that EZY8894 is scheduled to depart at 12:00 but estimated at 11:00, it's going to leave early?!
@easyJet Yes, I know but I sent a couple of emails but with no answer so far. So could you help or make them answer?
