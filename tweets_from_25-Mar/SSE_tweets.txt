Netley #33kV #substation energised today by @SSE Great job by all the #team involved!
@SSE but is ok because I can get a call back on Monday afternoon.
@SSE I have reached my limit 1 hr 34 mins on bloody hold. Even if you are the cheapest your piss poor service means my money is elsewhere.
@SSE on hold for 1 hour 26 minutes and 50 seconds currently. Customer service tick right there. Atrocious.
@SSE I've been waiting for somebody to come out to my address, as an emergency, and nobody has shown yet? Can I check up on this please?
@sse how's it going with fixing the old smart meter read outs then. Would have thought it would be sorted by now to be honest ?
The latest THE #ENERGY OBSERVER! https://t.co/T3kOOiD6fJ Thanks to @SSE @MikeHudema @aub_luv #solar #nuclear
The @SSE Wildcats has started for Girls aged 5-11 but there is still time to join!

@SSE nice to see 2 weeks after you said this would be fixed that my meter is still being absurd.starting to doubt my next bill now!
@SSE Is there a power cut in Milltimber, Aberdeen?
@SSE can you imagine thieving electric companies being fair. https://t.co/fnjpjruENK
@SSE Oh, and we sent you a reading about a month ago, which you seem to have ignored.
@SSE WEDS - meter read by SSE man. FRI - we get ESTIMATED bill that doubles our payments (way above actual usage). How useless are you?
