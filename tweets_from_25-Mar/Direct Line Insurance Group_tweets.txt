@DirectLine_UK hi, what's the earliest I can talk to you about my policy renewal? It expires 22/04. Thanks!
@DirectLine_UK please tell me how to make a complaint.
@DirectLine_UK Tried phoning twice and line drops after selecting option 3 on IVR.  Web login continuously asks retry in 15 minutes

@DirectLine_UK pls pass on my thanks to Jacob who sorted my car insurance renewal last night. He did a sterling job!
Don't book car insurance with @DirectLine_UK they auto renewed my yearly policy which I didn't tick. £420! + now charging a can't fee.
@DirectLine_UK Great service. Thanks again!
@DirectLine_UK no. But then again..my insurance does pay the hmrc mileage allowance when settling claim and not 10p/mile like you tw4ts
@avivaplc While @AdmiralUK wanted 50% more than @axainsurance or @DirectLine_UK, your quotation was the worst #RipOff at nearly 100% more!
@DirectLine_UK yes I'll do that now. Hope that all made sense. Had to write it across a few tweets. Thanks.
@DirectLine_UK ... my husbands status from partner to husband. Please help (end)
@DirectLine_UK ... I'm confused and the guy on the phone didn't really explain it to me well and just said there was a charge for updating..
@DirectLine_UK ...is the correct? I already updated my married name last year with you so surely why weren't these details updated?...
@DirectLine_UK ... and therefore my husband needed to be updated from partner to spouse. I was told I would have to be charged for this...
@DirectLine_UK I've just rang up as i noticed some details were incorrect on my car policy. Such as my marital status &amp; home owner status...
@DirectLine_UK are the most unfair company I have ever dealt with. Makes buying your first car feel like you are doing something wrong 😡😡😡
@DirectLine_UK benefited from this facility yesterday. Thank you
@charlkerridge @DirectLine_UK if you fancy a change give us a call 👍🏻👍🏻
