@Tesco shop elsewhere for flowers for their mother, I know the usual prices and these rises are wrong for this weekend
@Tesco it appears that you need wardens at the back of the car park to your New Malden store. So many drivers go in through the no entry
@Tesco the mother day bouquets were ¬£30 and have never been that price, I shop in Tesco regularly and was so disgusted told my 3 sons to
@Tesco your store manager at Hammersmith was setting a gd e.g! Smoking right next to the petrol station and just throwing his fag down !!!!
@Tesco hi. Do you get clubcard points when purchasing foreign currency?
Why does @Tesco feel it necessary to change every aisle in Hindley store. Is it just to piss me off and give the staff more work
@ReverendAlly saw a very small boy instructing a older lady (Gran?) on how to 'scan and shop' in @Tesco  today #verycute
@TinaThudBump @Tesco There is more limited choice e.g. one type of ketchup/ beans, maybe 4 types of yoghurt etc so less likely to overspend
Why is @Tesco now charging for click and collect on groceries? Sure it used to be free! @asda provide the same service for free ü§î
