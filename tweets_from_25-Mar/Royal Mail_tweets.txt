@RoyalMail waited in all day for a redelivery. No show. Thanks so much for wasting my day/weekend...
@Gemmachandler5 @RoyalMail Hi Gemma, so sorry to hear this. Please DM us your delivery postcode or order number so we can sort this for you!
@RoyalMail not impressed, sent flowers via @BloomandWild to my Mum in Scotland. It's not arrived, despite showing in your depot yesterday
Still no #MassEffectAndromeda :( @boomeranggames please complain to @RoyalMail not happy.
Another glorious job by @RoyalMail. Tracking says 'out for delivery' at 6am, still not here over 12hrs later. Whole day wasted. #TopService
@HonestBrew @YodelOnline why don't they have a depot in Wales' capital?It's not even open on Sun and closes at 12 on Sat.Pls use @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail found this on the floor outside my flat in Putney... Let me know how to return it to you... :) https://t.co/SofpXFrdto
Turns out the package I was expecting for the last 10 days has been sitting at the @RoyalMail depot and they never bothered to leave a card.
@RoyalMail is there a way that we can confirm the address on it without me twitting It publicly
@RoyalMail Hi could I get a number to speak to someone, I sent a parcel to.croatia and seems to be stuck.in france, need to find out why.
@laurahookham @RoyalMail typical it's mother's day flowers being delivered and now what's gonna happen? No flowers on mother's day?
@RoyalMail can you please find out how this is possible as the delivery has now gone back to the supplier. So frustrating @PSandgrove
@RoyalMail wasted all day waiting for a delivery. Told that you 'couldn't identify address' Who delivers our post then? Carrier pigeon?
I wonder why @RoyalMail vans driving around #Gainsborough town center don't have indicators. Weird!

.@RoyalMail tried to deliver today which I could have done with for tonight but not left like yesterday's parcel. Of course not.
Never any consistency from @RoyalMail. Sometimes parcels are left in safe place, sometimes with neighbours, sometimes taken back to depot.
@danielwebster92 @RoyalMail maybe it wasn't their fault? (What do I know? I'm American. We have an orange toddler as our leader.)
@RoyalMail just had a very bad experience, how do I complain?! 25 days later - and I still haven't received my package!
@RoyalMail during the week or can I collect on Sunday?
@RoyalMail Buzzer next to postbox but wasn't called &amp; no calling card in postbox. Address correct. Paid extra 4 special del as needed today.
@RoyalMail u guys attempted to deliver my package today and I wasn't in, it says collect next working day does that mean I have to collect
@RoyalMail can you advise. Waited in all morning for special delivery. Tracking says attempted@12.12 &amp; del@12.56 but no package or POD.
@RoyalMail waiting in line half an hour to pick up a package from your E8 collection office #shitservice
@RoyalMail - I have some 11.5p stamps. Can I combine two to get 23p for postage? Or do you have to round down?

@RoyalMail I am outraged,the delivery driver hasnt even rung my doorbell &amp; I have now missed my Mothers Day gift. Utter disgraceful service
Did I also mention NO red card was left? @RoyalMail special delivery is a waste of time &amp; money.
@RoyalMail Always fun picking up post from your E Belfast depot. 2 buses, to get there and then understaffed. Yay!

@RoyalMail envelope is clearly a signed for letter yet was put in to letter box without even ringing doorbell for signature. not impressed
- @RoyalMail its 12:04pm any chance of you actually delivering my fucking mail today so I can go do my job.... Thanks.
Oh, and a refund won't be offered if the COMPUTER shows that delivery was attempted. Worst #customerexperience I've ever had @RoyalMail
So @RoyalMail will NOT log complaints if their computer shows delivery was attempted. Why hasn't this poor #customerservice been exposed?
the @RoyalMail self service machines are so pointless, you have to wait for about 10 minutes for a member of staff to help you
