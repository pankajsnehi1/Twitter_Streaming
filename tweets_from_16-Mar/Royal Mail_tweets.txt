@RoyalMail Seriously worried re 3 missing Signed For 1st Class pcls sent to 3 diff loc from same PO on same transaction. Can't wait 2 wks
@Kellieann01 @RoyalMail doubt it right enough!!
@picklemonsterG @RoyalMail hopefully Royal Mail respond to this!!
@Kellieann01 @RoyalMail honestly my heart was in my mouth the whole time driving behind him and it was one of the enormous big lorries!
@picklemonsterG @RoyalMail that's terrible, I see it all too often, flying up and down the street bearing in mind they're next to the school
@RoyalMail hi! Back on this. Still hasn't arrived
@Kellieann01 @RoyalMail guy had to slam on breaks and move car near central reservation!
@Kellieann01 @RoyalMail honestly wouldn't let a woman pull out of slip Road on m74 and almost rammed her. Then skipped lanes at a roundabout
@TKMxEvolution @EmmaJChelsea @RoyalMail it's the prerogative of moaners to complain on Twitter but won't say nowt in person
@picklemonsterG @RoyalMail happens constantly on my street Mrs, I've seen it loads of times, disgrace and accident waiting to happen
Absolutely disgusted by appalling&amp;dangerous driving from @RoyalMail van tonight almost took 2 cars out of action from Glasgow to Motherwell!
@jasemonkey @RoyalMail fucking moaner. It's a bubble bag that has gone through the mail system I will get creased. Irresponsible sender
@chashodges2017 @EmmaJChelsea @RoyalMail I mean, can you imagine complaining about somewhere not being open when you arrive before it opens?
@RoyalMail why is there only a surname on the fee to pay card?  It would really be useful to know who the parcel is for, or where from...
@TKMxEvolution @EmmaJChelsea @RoyalMail @TrollingPostbox 8pm you bastards are having a laugh I got to wait until that late #cunts
@TKMxEvolution @EmmaJChelsea @RoyalMail what's the point in opening at 8pm they Aint going to get much business at that hour
@EmmaJChelsea @RoyalMail the worst thing about that is the patronising way they called you love.

@Weezie1611 @RoyalMail nope! Wasn't impressed
@Weezie1611 @RoyalMail these were left for anyone to take though - one had a cheque for ¬£560 in!
So my complaint about my missing parcel was investigated by @RoyalMail for them to say it was delivered to my address #dontthinkso

@RoyalMail is there any delivery tomorrow in Northern Ireland as it's a bank holiday?
@RoyalMail people's livelihoods depend on your service and when it goes wrong your customer service is appalling. Last time I ever use you
@RoyalMail when I asked about the procedures your rep was very unhelpful and hung up on me and I am nowhere nearer
@RoyalMail the bank were supposed to receive my documents on Monday. Nobody can tell me where they are - this is unacceptable
How does @RoyalMail deliver a package to the wrong country
@RoyalMail just had a staff member hang up on me while making a complaint... absolutely shocking customer service!!

@RoyalMail absolutely ridiculous! Everything I order ends up in the post office WHICH IS NEVER OPEN

@RoyalMail like 3 years ago
@RoyalMail i have a tracking no o was sent by text if thats any use
@RoyalMail no item numb - nothing. Ridiculous sum1 thinks they can leave a card wi no details on. Poor customer service thats all i can say.

Mail problems - again, Dm sent @RoyalMail

@RoyalMail Thank you, but no way to prove you paid customs? Would be nice if you were to provide evidence to the customer!
@RoyalMail just send DM
@RoyalMail mail just left in the communal staircase.... mail is going missing! Not acceptable. https://t.co/teeupqMfwj
@lauramarlinghq totally totally gutted that @RoyalMail has lost my tickets for tonight's gig at Brighton üòû
@RoyalMail no mail in 4 days and waiting on a parcel is there anyone delivering post in cumbernauld g67 area this week?
@royalmail if parcel is lost can it be located from.last destination or do I claim ?
@RoyalMail didnt even get any post. How about i park on your driveway? Parking Fine coming your way #rude‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Lz9smsXsiU
@RoyalMail that's what I thought but the people in the post office ate telling people you can. So it's a bit confusing. Thanks for reply
@RoyalMail yes
@RoyalMail ok thanks for the update
@RoyalMail but will this make him come back and deliver the package?
@RoyalMail ok thanks
@RoyalMail you need to train your postmen on how to deliver packages correctly
@RoyalMail yes it works fine - but conceded it was left sticking out as there was a cheque in one of the envelopes
@RoyalMail these are park tickets that we've paid over ¬£1500 for üò°
@RoyalMail Wont be complaining, but expect a lot more bad royal mail parking pics to appear, as this is not just a one off
@RoyalMail What happens if it doesnt? I wasnt ask what the value was at the post office so assumed first class would be fine
@RoyalMail This is a huge bloody problem! This has NOT been delivered to me, not has a card been put through my doo‚Ä¶ https://t.co/BlQLdOVEsE
@RoyalMail no, semi detached house built mid 90s. 94a and 94b must have replaced existing detached house 94 back then.
@RoyalMail can you please tell your postman to stop walking though my garden to deliver my mail ! There is a path you know ! üò†
Who do I contact about receiving a suspicious package @RoyalMail ? https://t.co/vijKTON0hL
@RoyalMail I have not, how do I raise a complaint?
@RoyalMail done x
Why do @RoyalMail close at half 12? Working people don't have time to go to town and try catch you when open to collect items they paid for.
@RoyalMail the bell works, they could have tickled the door and I would have heard, I happened to be right by it. Approx an hour ago
@RoyalMail number but they can't actually even track it until the item is delivered.
@RoyalMail the most incompetent organisation I have ever come accross. Why pay for 1st class signed for &amp; get given a tracking
@RoyalMail first class signed for parcels are not tracked through the post? Yet another parcel lost 2nd in 2 weeks. RM totally unreliable
@RoyalMail yes they haven't received it
@RoyalMail when I am or where ?
@RoyalMail Thanks so much for your help. My son will be relieved - needs it to keep the mozzies away! I'll pack it carefully. Thanks again.
Thanks @RoyalMail for the safe delivery of my post üòí https://t.co/eqmEPWjtcK

@RoyalMail what's with the shortage of stamps in Leeds? Can't you print and deliver enough?
@RoyalMail I'm almost sure you guys should be apologetically chasing me, not me desperately asking Twitter for help....
@RoyalMail Claim made 23rd January  - P58_656484924000
@RoyalMail are you able to tell me if my parcel will be delivered today? I paid for 48hr delivery but it doesn't look like it'll be here
@RoyalMail hi, can I send a postal tube 60cm long by 10cm dia as a small parcel. Post office says yes, can find confirmation on RM website.
@RoyalMail hello can you help with a tracking - says delivery attempted at Battersea PDO - not my address and no card received? ü§î
@RoyalMail tracked my item which was meant to be delivered today. It's gone through a mis-sort scan..What is this? Will it be with me today?
@royalmail Thank you for being amazing today and managing to get my package to me, despite the wrong address being on it! Super helpful team
@RoyalMail thank you I'll do that can i still claim as this wasn't a tracked service i also don't have a postage slip
@royalmail I am trying to set up a mail redirect but house we are moving to isn't coming up! We're 94a, only showing 92, 94, 96 etc. Help?

@RoyalMail have now sent a message across with the evidence ohotos
@RoyalMail well funnily enough it turned up at 21:50 which is shocking. Been receiving mail at ridiculous hours recently.

@RoyalMail thank you very much.
@RoyalMail Thanks for the reply. 50% of the item value is excessive when I'm already paying the tax on the item from the shop though

@UPS Can't find us AGAIN despite clear signage and being on @RoyalMail postcode finder!!!
@RoyalMail can you please step away from your customer service script and try to give me some reassurance https://t.co/UJ4jECGhoQ
@RoyalMail your service EVEN worse than @Se_Railway which, as @quantick will attest is saying something (but crucially DOING nothing)
@RoyalMail I'm afraid that when I tried that online it told me it wasn't an option.
@RoyalMail please can youbsteonaway from your customer service script and try to give me some reassurance https://t.co/BMBoBvS40l
@RoyalMail I understand, but what if they dont arrive? Its been 9 days since i sent them
@RoyalMail well that's pointless isn't it
@RoyalMail hour long phone call xferred 5 times. explain everything each time. last operator "anything else i can help you with?" like what?
@RoyalMail I mentioned doorbell, he said 1)most of the time doorbells don't work 2)he had too many houses to deliver to to try doorbells

@RoyalMail I've created a label online using click and drop but selected the wrong address and it's been paid for. I'll obviously be buying

@marcusgalley @RoyalMail Law unto themselves unfortunately. Just look at what they do &amp; don't charge VAT to...
@RoyalMail thanks - I'll pass on my feedback - but it would still be better if I could arrange redelivery to a neighbour!
@RoyalMail lost package in January still no news, no compensation, no update.  Appalling customer service. Dread chasing other lost mail now
@sophiemaelol @RoyalMail Russia üëÄüëÄ
@RoyalMail No problem. I'm surprised that in today's world you need an address to warn a local PO distribution centre. Oh well.
@RoyalMail if I send u my tracking number can u check this please?
@RoyalMail Is it part of postmen's training to tell them not to ring doorbells?  For expensive Special Deliv,  I'd expect some persistence!
@RoyalMail postperson was smoking when delivering my mail, kindly posted the smoke through my letterbox. Thanks for the cigarette smell...
@RoyalMail Waiting for parcel. Posted 1st class on Monday. Next day? Ha! Milton Keynes to Cardiff shouldn't take this long! Poor service!!

@RoyalMail considering it isn't the senders fault - i'll actually be looking further into making a claim against you as a customer too.
@SonaBoner @RoyalMail country unknown LOL sounds decent!!!

@RoyalMail I ordered several items from ebay but delivery address doesn't have  my apartment number. Is there anyone 2 contact to sort out?

@RoyalMail no, but I must also note that I was in at the time of delivery - and am disappoint to say that no attempt at delivery was made.
@RoyalMail I've followed you so you can direct message me

@RoyalMail thanks for getting back. Another tenant called Mount Pleasant and was told the building had been forgotten.  All resolved now.

@RoyalMail now following
@RoyalMail ok thanks for all your help! ‚ò∫
