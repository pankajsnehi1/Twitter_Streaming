If you like chillies, don't bother with the so called 'Komodo chillies' from @Tesco because they're not the hottest in the UK!
They're shit!

@Tesco it was Lurpak Lighter Spreadable
@Tesco are they sure? It was around 3:12PM according to the reciept, the security cameras might be able to see if i picked it up or not
@King_Kalakaua @Tesco it's a great price. Very few books would sell at £20 here.
@Tesco thank you, DM and info sent.
@Millie_Liza @hippeas_snacks @Tesco @Joshua_107 @olly_horner I can totally see our yellow case there !
@JaneCaseyAuthor Completely blows my mind how @Tesco can do this. A fiver? A new hardcover in the US is $25-30. Might get lucky @ $20.

@Tesco store was Earl's Court. Whether they were there behind the scenes or not, why is it that pale shades are favoured? #whitewash #makeup
@Tesco @tescomobile they replied. Seems the customer is punished for reporting crimes. Charged to report a break in.

@Tesco thanks. It was the one last thing I went in to Tesco for, so you've completely lost my custom now.
@TescoOpticians @Tesco #Tesco seem to want to blame you @GalaxyOptical for their wrong eyetests, are you their incompetent subcontractor?

Anyone ever had a good customer service experience with @Tesco? I haven't, and starting to take it personally. Yet still shocked every time.
Went to buy concealer in @Tesco but realised only people with my coloured skin (pale white) could buy any. So I didn't #makeup #whitewash

@Tesco okay but it's been over 2 months. You're Tesco how hard can it be to paint a wall? One thing you are doing is bringing down the area
@Tesco then why had it taking nearly a year to have your wall painted? How is that addressing?

@Tesco the replacement isn't an identical product so it's not a replacement. Its Tesco value fabric conditioner, which I wasn't allergic to.
@Tesco I carry a yoghurt to work and nearly every tub or lid has split open during my journey. Will be buying another value brand in future

In store batteries run dead when trying to scan own shopping.  delivery slots late 😨

@Tesco why have you reduced the no. Of flavours in your value yoghurt packs from 4 to 2? I hate peach! Also the new package design is awful
Super customer service this morning from @Tesco - a very chatty Italian delivery man. We put the world to rights ready for the day ahead!
@Tesco thank you for such a quick and fantastic response to my complaint.
@Tesco @TescoOffersMore have just expanded their free from range - #happiness right there i say ❤🤤
@Tesco I have just noticed that you have an imperfect berry mix, is that the same thing pretty much? ☺
@Tesco No where else was open at the time I needed (other than my Tesco) so I just went digital download! Shall be smashing it today 😬

@Tesco Ok, that's understandable. But why the varying prices on different times? Surely the costs for collection 2pm are the same as 8pm?
@Tesco thanks, you mean like a click and collect sort of arrangement?
@Tesco am tempted to give online home delivery another shot because of him
@Tesco Well done to your customer services manager who rectified it in a quick and pleasant way

@aw_nz Too strong passwords are a serious problem, Andrew. I'm glad @Tesco is proudly fighting them, one ^ at a time! @mattdufeu
@Tesco thanks Jayne xxx https://t.co/kwwovwlQ8P
@MetroUK Bit shitty how you've used a @Tesco brand pic in your headline, when it's an overall, ibuprofen statement.
@mattdufeu @PWTooStrong @Tesco sadly, you wrote too many numbers and upper/lower case letters. Only one allowed!
🤣
@Tesco @mattdufeu what does "e.g." mean then? And why is password strength limited. You *do* hash passwords, right?
@Tesco yep, sure no worries. Would I be best to drain the water that's in the pot away?
@Tesco And before any keyboard warriors launch a war, I appreciate that it's actually an "All our food is prepared fresh" message. Relax.

When @Tesco haven't delivered my food, and have 💩 customer service meaning I won't get my brioche in the morning. Y. What if I had a family.
@Tesco My apologies I should have been clearer when i said lorry, what i actually meant was HGV as you put it, sorry for the confusion.
