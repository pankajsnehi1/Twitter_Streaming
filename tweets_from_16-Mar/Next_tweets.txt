@nextofficial it's just in general. It's assuming you can only be "petite" up to a certain size after that you have to have longer length

@nextofficial thank you so much, I've DM'd you - out of 7 items, only one was available, 6 were either out of stock or up to 11 week wait 😱
@nextofficial my slot for 8pm has disappeared! I've now got to wait for 10.30, not impressed with that!
@nextofficial can you tell me the sale times For Hedge End please. It comes up with general opening times on site x
I just found some beautiful bath mats and towels by @nextofficial which are a good and cheaper alternative to Missoni's #homedecor #blogger

Got everything in the @nextofficial sale. #Firsttime 🤗
The @nextofficial VIP sale is a joke. Unless you're a size 6/8 or 20/22 then you're laughing. At a 5.30pm slot, that's appalling.
@nextofficial I've been trying to add things to basket on the VIP sale and I get logged out every time. Highly annoying and time consuming
@nextofficial ordered these online and it looks like they've been thrown against a wall https://t.co/P56ch1PREQ
@nextofficial Is there any way to stop the directory being sent? I always look on the website, never use the directory #green
Cannot add @nextofficial item 454-440 to bag at all! Why is their website so glitchy? No view all option, either. Very frustrating site!

My most recent shopping experience with @nextofficial was diabolical
My most recent shopping experience with @RobertDyas was delightful
@nextofficial still not fixed. I can't trust sending the unwanted suits back and replacing them until I know I'm getting the right stuff.
