@easyJet I'm late. I'm tired. I'm SO GRUMPY. You have delayed me so much you pricks. Come on!!!!!!!!
@easyJet thank you. After today's experience we won't fly with anyone else!
what can you do by Sunday to make it a better experience @easyJet ?
Many different variants and all different liveries but you gotta love the only orange in the skies that is @easyJet https://t.co/jqbsXPIwor
.@easyJet yeah, hopefully not much time and no messing about. It's a huge amount to be left without when you're trying to move house.
It is more expensive to get to #Benidorm via Alicante with @easyJet than to #Dubai from #Heathrow with @British_Airways
@iamdanielyoung @easyJet hope your flight wasnt delayed for too long!
@McWhirterAlex @flybe would be better doing an IOM-AMS service - before @easyjet gets in there
Hello @easyJet . Im checking in some audio equipment for a recording in Spain. Do you provided “fragile” stickers so don’t arrive broken?

Hi @easyJet , where would you say the beginning of the plane is?
@davidtflea @easyJet spastic
Flew @easyJet to Madrid and @iberiaexpress back. Easyjet wins hands down. By a country mile. It's not even a close contest.
I think @easyJet needs a scientific consultant in their PR team. Spot the mistake... https://t.co/PT4Cox3THi
.@easyJet I hate tweets like this but £165 to add a hold bag for me, my wife and child is rich guys.
@easyJet - any news on nice to Geneva last flight yet?
Hey @easyJet I'm still waiting for an invoice required 2 months ago? Asked 3 times! Can someone move its a** and give me something??!!
@easyJet I didn't add a middle name to a booking by mistake. Does this matter? My "manage bookings" isn't working, how else can I change it?
@easyJet you suck.
@easyJet - Any news on whether we'll get from Nice  to Geneva tonight? And now I've missed my transfer how will I be reimbursed?

@easyJet you forgot to reply to me and now I'm out of my 24 hour cancellation period 🙁
@easyJet this is more communication than we received the 2 days we were stuck in Berlin. Seriously not happy about how we've been treated.
@easyJet so would really appreciate it if you guys would handle this in a proper manner, instead of a short email to fob it off. Thank you.
@easyJet not a misunderstanding. The hotel told us you had overbooked, and you were told about it, but we weren't informed.
@easyJet not true, it was less than 24 hrs in advance. I just want my train ticket reimbursed, not even asking for the €250 fee.
@easyJet which I claimed for reimbursement. However, the reply of custsrvc is that I was informed "well in advance" of the cancellation

@easyJet if delayed flight meant delayed boarding gate time, would spend more in retail &amp; restaurants! Sat for an hour at the gate instead 😳
@easyjet Don't assume the man is the primary plus cardholder. Joint mail should be addressed to both people! Black mark for sexist attitude!
@vueling 19:40 flight London GTW to BCN delayed 1h for operacional reasons. Curiously enough. @easyJet one at 19:50 on time. #shameonyou

@easyJet despite the fact I paid this on the day of my cancelled flight because I had to arrange an extra night at my hotel
@easyJet just told my claim for compensation has been denied because the receipt I provided is a 'pre flight arrangement'.
@Flycare_eu @easyJet not their fault for the strike, but equally they shouldn't have promised something then retracted. Thanks anyways.

@easyJet not letting you board the plane when it's still sat their waiting 😩😡😡
@easyJet very confused. App says delayed until 09.45 but airport screen say delay until 11.00. Which one do I belie… https://t.co/N9MmQw1yPh
@easyJet really ridiculous that I have to put my hand luggage in the hold,it's the correct size, we are on time, and no compensation. #cheap
@easyJet next flight 23/03 !!!
@easyJet i can't seem to find the area on the website to cancel my flight. Any ideas?
@easyJet do I have one?
@easyJet just checked online card statement. Happy to see refund. No confirmation however of membership
@easyJet - hi, I need to add hold luggage to a flight - how best can I do this?
@antisyzygy They tried to tell me it isn't a data breach - I beg to differ! I was promised an email yesterday, nothing. Shock! @easyJet
@easyJet I have a boarding pass on my app but want to print it as well (just in case my phone dies). Is this possible?

@andrewrtw @easyJet @LPL_Airport great pic. Didn't realise the 319 had shark fins.
Foggy start today, @easyJet flight delayed, could have done with extra hour in bed when the alarm went off at 4am 😵 #travel #earlymornings
@easyJet Hi - I've got a question and can't find an email address, form or contact number. Please provide one? I can't web chat, i'm at work
@Chappers2013 @STN_Airport @easyJet Enjoy! 4 paws left in good hands?
@Chappers2013 @easyJet That's what we love to hear! 😊Have a great time hitting the slopes! ⛷
Camino al aeropuerto. Gracias @NHHotels (@nhhotelsde) y @easyJet por estos días extras "forzados" en Berlín https://t.co/vhsFbIyz27
@easyJet Big Dutch typo on your inchecken-pagina bij handbagage: handvaten moet zijn handvatten.
@easyJet oh and now it's delayed even further. Over a 2 hour delay now. You've ruined my trip before I've even arrived there. CRAP company
@easyJet I'm only off for a few days but you've already cut that trip even shorter. Good job. Definitely THE LAST time I travel with you
@easyJet I normally avoid travelling with you because you're renowned for delays &amp; congratulations, today's no exception
Blimey!!! I wonder what @easyJet are going to do about it!? https://t.co/CwJ5RLe7eW
@LDNLutonAirport extremely rude and blunt staff at both check in and security - what an unpleasant experience @easyJet
@easyJet hi, will I be able to bring 2x small plants in my hand luggage from Manchester to Berlin?

@easyJet is it normal that we don't have to provide any ID information in our account ?
Just had to force my handbag into my carry on case because @easyJet doesn't have clear guidelines as to what I'm allowed. #absolutejoke
Alarm went off @0305 but, sadly, delayed @easyJet flight from @EDI_Airport means won't make meeting in Kent before lunchtime. #annoying
@Chappers2013 @STN_Airport @easyJet oh even nicer!! Have fun! ⛷⛷

All aboard @easyJet for Geneva! ⛷🎿
@easyJet u just insisted to put my hand luggage in the hold bc the flight was full. Doors have shut &amp;I'm sat with 10 empty seats in view..👍🏼
@sophiessuitcse @easyJet Sounds amazing! We hope you both have an awesome time👏🏼 Dino &amp; Pete
@CapitalEastMids @easyJet off to Paris for 48 hours with the best friend! We ironically met at uni in Nottingham!

@easyJet hi am I allowed to take a buggy onboard flight for 3 year old when we are only taking hand luggage?
@easyJet Do I really have to keep lodging a complaint? Since 2/03 6 of 14 flights with other airlines due to non-response of EasyJet.
@easyJet Bernini have phoned on several occasions, logged official complaints regarding EasyJet plus membership but still no response
.@easyjet queue in full swing - stretching to around 5 gates long. Perhaps we should revise baggage rules or everyone should CTFO.

@easyJet hateful user experience for the highest price you can sell. Do you think it's fair ? If there is a bus, don't sell the SB option
@easyJet you say "please use SB to board first in order to secure your space". Liars when there is a bus before boarding in the plane
@easyJet and your staff who doesn't care... what a wonderful company
@easyJet paying the speedy boarding option to be the first to board in the bus and the last to board in the plane. Commercial lie. Angry
@easyJet normal flight home from #easyjet #delayed #leastyourconsistant. And you want me to fill in a survey 🤔 https://t.co/hsIesnjHBS
@easyJet @LDNLutonAirport can you explain why it cost £3 to drop people off, I thought u wanted people to use your facilities???????????????
@easyJet Your online check in sucks. It's ok. Got nothing better to do at 0430 than stand in a huge queue at the terminal. 👍🏼
Gatwick express timetable not updated online. @easyJet I have 14 minutes to get to my gate before it closes at 5:50 will this work?
