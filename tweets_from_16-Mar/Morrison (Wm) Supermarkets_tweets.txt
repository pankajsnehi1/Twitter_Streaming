@hjmac41 @Morrisons I had the misfortune to be in the new brighton store, almost wanted to jump in the sea
I must say @Morrisons customer service are very helpful. Unlike the store staff, who never crack a smile!

@PorcelainSket @Morrisons @MorrisonsNews MORRISONS HOW COULD YOU
@kerribailey123 @Morrisons if you put a few copper pennies in your vase with the tulips (and water obvs) it keeps your tulips stood upright!
@Morrisons don't "reduce" an item if there is then the chance of ending up paying more. Or reduce them enough so this cant possibly happen.
@Morrisons sorry don't have a more card. Just thought you and your customers needed to be aware.
@Morrisons I did notice this. But no "full price" blueberries available. Thought the system would cope.
@kerribailey123 @Morrisons it's my birthday next week. Can I have some too 😉💐

Did you report @Morrisons to us for breaking formula marketing regs? Is your photo in #lwtduk17 monitoring report? https://t.co/7FAaMzC8Qz
@Morrisons Solved it now, but took me 30min and your website is definitely all kinds of crap. It literally wouldn't let me check out.
