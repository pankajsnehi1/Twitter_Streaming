@virginmedia I was looking at the deal for full house with HD movies for 55pm but was told no go😠 keeping BB but TV from @SkyUK 1of2
Anyone else in the Durham area having issues with their @SkyUK broadband? @SkyHelpTeam
@MadleeRage29 @SkyUK I cursed the box and then noticed his expression. Nearly had an accident of my own... 😂

@SamGill70127111 @SkyUK ''tis a good look indeed! 😝
Was fast forwarding my @SkyUK  Sky+ box when it froze... poor Len 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/a9I3twhsmk
When your @SkyUK broadband simply stops working. How can I work from home with no wifi @SkyHelpTeam ridiculous.
...the cost for putting a new line in. Non existent customer service from both @bt_uk and @SkyUK instead blaming me for their balls up!!!
@SkyUK @bt_uk your working relationship is abismal. Loss of internet, 3-5 days to fix, no proper complaints procedure. Astounding!
I never agreed to any cancellation but yet it still went ahead and neither @bt_uk or @SkyUK are willing to reinstate a line but leave me...
After a huge screw up by @BT and @SkyUK I now have no phone line and am going to be charged for a new one! Not happy at all... 1 of 2

@davidwalliams @SkyUK I love this woman. She doesn't get the credit she deserves thanks to the vile British press who love to pull down
@Lucccccccccccy @GhostAdventures @SkyUK Hey Lucy, you can catch up on demand on @UKTVPlay :)
Day 1 with @SkyUK and so far not impressed. Very unhelpful on the phone.
@SkyUK what a bunch of hopeless idiots you are. So much effort and resource for sales. One person and their dog for delivery.
@SkyUK are so bad at messing people's bills up! Cancelling after contracts up #pileofshite
@startmentor @SkyUK It's been rubbish in our house for years, considering how much we pay! Taking our custom for granted #notgoodenough
@SkyUK had an engineer out last week and was told Sky would contact to check the issue is sorted (which it isn't) but have heard nothing..?
Why do @SkyUK @ProductionPark_ @IBM @OfficialHARIBO @landg_uk @CocaCola @provfin choose @LeedsCityRegion? #MIPIM2017 https://t.co/BvU2NzNuBr

Why does my internet NEVER work. Only pay about £5000 a month to @SkyUK #CrapService
Where do @SkyUK get off charging extra sneakily this moth! £4.09 is a bit of a hike mate! No correspondence made to warn me 😣
Absolute joke @SkyUK. Every single day. So much for 39-41mbps. Can't wait for this contract to end! https://t.co/wig4w74qUZ
When the hospital wifi works better than your @SkyUK fibre. 🙃
@SkyUK you always seem to drive away customers after you have them so long billing me a month early for no reason what so ever

Go on. You know you want too! https://t.co/4NwdczqL91
@SkyUK your service is so shit! 5 days again with no phone now no internet! And you Don't reply to emails 😡😡😡😡😡
@SkyUK spent over an hr on the phone as you incorrectly charged me 3mths, staff are great but had to transfer me 3 times then got cut off!

@davidwalliams @SkyUK Great Duo, can't wait to see you two there. 👍🏼😀
What a surprise my @SkyUK broadband is not working. Again. Except rather than just disconnecting it is taking me to a "self heal page" #fail
@TheRock @SevenBucksProd @HBO @BallersHBO any idea of UK date? @SkyUK
@SkyUK only getting 3.5Mb. Ridiculous. I'm on unlimited broadband. Useless for streaming games on PS4. https://t.co/jCWp4aCGmw
@SkyUK but at least they charged me what they quoted and didn't charge every three weeks #payMONTHLY #SkyTakeMoneyAsTheyPlease #RipOff #Shit
@SkyUK your sad sack half arsed over priced slow as shit service is as bad as my TalkTalk was and that got hacked.
@SkyUK how come my recordings keep self-deleting if i pause them halfway through &amp; go out for a few hours? Your service keeps getting worse.
@SkyUK Why is this sky go player you have enforced on us, so terrible? Pixelated image and awful sound quality. Another disappointment.
