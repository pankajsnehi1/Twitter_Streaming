Always polite on the phone when renewing as well.

I love @DirectLine_UK what a joy to deal with!
@DirectLine_UK No problem
@DirectLine_UK pardon me?
. @DirectLine_UK no Craig, we expected a courtesy car, not an adventure with @UKEnterprise FAIL.
@DirectLine_UK @UKEnterprise   Finally have the car and it has virtually no fuel. Apparently we need to return it in the same condition 😡
@DirectLine_UK now @UKEnterprise to uplift our ‘courtesy car’. Which they don’t have. How hard can this be?!
@DirectLine_UK have recommended you to my friends now. Thank you so much.
