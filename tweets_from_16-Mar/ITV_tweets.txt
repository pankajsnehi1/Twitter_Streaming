@markpougatch @ITV @GlennHoddle not like Clattenburg to be centre of attention. What a poor call.
@Antnee198 @itvfootball @ITV @GlennHoddle @markpougatch all clubs travel worldwide during preseason unless u live in a different world
@ITV why is Lethal Weapon no longer on the ITV hub
@paparazi75 @itvfootball @ITV @GlennHoddle @markpougatch And about club he played for that has to travel worldwide… https://t.co/JwkUhRwF5W
Once the initial run is over @ITV need to move #NightlyShow to 10.30, make it 45mins, add live music to finish each show &amp; give it to Davina

@ERuthuk @ITV @HarryHill @alienfuncapsule @EamonnHolmes First time I've caught this. Refreshingly funny. Must watch again next week! Ta :)
At 10pm it's @ITV 's #NightlyShow with 'Benjamin Netanyahu' that'll ramp up the ratings 🤦🏻‍♂️👍@TVKev @HylandIan failure is not an option. 🤔
Prime Suspect 1973 @itv this is so wooden they could make chairs out of it
@ITV @ITV4 @YouTube would be great to see it contains highlights on itv but no

After hearing such good things im finally giving @ITV @BroadchurchTV a go. Cant understand why I havent watched this yet 🤓🤔🔎
Huge penalty call by Clattenberg in Germany &amp;  lots of Man Utd puffing &amp; panting. 11-15 @ITV if we're spared with @GlennHoddle &amp; Roy Keane
Feet up only now watching the last episode of #Thegoodkarmahospital I do hope @ITV will do another series
@TracyKashi @ITV Watching it now. I think they took too long building it up.
@ITV Prime Suspect 1973 - Sam Reid is sooooooooo wooden
@TheShitelyShow @ITV yeah they need to cancel the nightly show
@5nightlyshite @ITV I feel bad for the news. It's ratings are terrible now thanks to that SHIT
