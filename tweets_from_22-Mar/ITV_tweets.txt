@ITV @ITVNightlyShow @itvnews good this programme is not worth watching. Load of rubbish
Gary Cahill's post-match interview was so good @ITV decided to show it twice #englandvsgermany
@RhysMessenger93 @ITV exactly. Poor journalism.
Summary of plot of Broadchurch S3-

All men are bastards.
Except for....
Oh wait. Nope. 
All of them.

@ITV #broadchurch
@MikeSmith_91 @ITV no need and not the time to ask a clearly unbriefed Cahill about that. What was he wanting him to say??
@CharlieKingTips @Podolski10 @ITV @andrewj54499780
@thejamesmax @ITV @itvnews ..... and with @julieetchitv The right person.
@RhysMessenger93 @ITV I wondered about that too. Especially given how they are in Germany. Not the sort of after match question you'd expect
Welcome back #NewsAtTen on @Itv shame it has to be like this üòØüò¢ @itvnews
@itvnews @ITV  knives???? Errr reported a knife? Get facts right
@RichHasland @ITV same, very unfair on him clearly wasn't briefed on that and not his job to discuss it. Poor from Gabriel Clarke.
.@ITV @itvnews It's nothing to do w/ events in Westminster. Even you are deeply ashamed of The Nightly Show.
After today's horrific events in #Westminster Definitely the right call to replace @ITV #thenightlyshow with @itvnews

Think it's about time @ITV stopped using #BitterSweetSymphony for their #England footie coverage. 
#OldHatNow
#Prophetic
@RhysMessenger93 @ITV I've just gone through other comments. A lot of people thinking same.
@ITV We all spent 2 hours watching England to divert us from a really shit day and you sign off with "sport is gloriously irrelevant".
@ITV how come Germany get their 4 stars on the highlights advert page (end of the itv coverage) and England didn't get their one!!!! #poor

@RichHasland @ITV extremely. What were they wanting him to say? Felt awkward for him!
#GERENG @ITV you should be discusted with that ending. Sport is completely relevant. How many lives has sports saved. #HaveSomeSense
@RhysMessenger93 @ITV I thought exactly the same. It was unfair to ask him that.
@ITV what a pathetic question to ask Cahill that was!!! #idiots
@ITV's coverage of this game has been so poor, bad commentary, extremely negative about Podolski and unnecessary comments Re London
Apalling that the interviewer on @ITV just asked Gary Cahill how the events in #Westminster were effecting the players
Lovely piece from @DanniiHud on beauty backstage @thevoiceuk @ITV https://t.co/XqVdAw7V4l
Pathetic questions from @itv asking Cahill how the events in London affected there game ?
Whys he asking Cahill about the events in Westminster. What's that got to do with being England captain? @ITV trying to be awkward?
@itv What a joke of a question to ask a footballer after a football match
Also @ITV's live coverage of football is consistently shocking. Always expect something to go wrong @itvfootball
Anyone interested @ITV have moved that shite The Nightly Show and putting on News 10pm - 11pm. Quite right too.
@MJTWinters28 @BBCMOTD @ITV How was that England's strongest team? It was a fucking friendly. Get over yourself.

as if @ITV let @IanWright0 talk all the way through @Podolski10 sooo bloody rude to talk over his sexy tone i must say!!!
130 games for his country only to have Lee Dixon whinging in a studio that the game is being delayed. Crap, @ITV. #Podolski
#Podolski @ITV really offended by the way your commentators treated that incredible moment.
Surprised that the @ITV commentators for the eng-ger game didn't talk over the national anthems as well. #Podolski
@ITV #ENGVGER no respect shown for podilski there. Dixon just said "can we start the game"
You do know that German TV would be more respectful to an outgoing legend. @ITV , you should give your commentators a lesson in humility
How disrespectful can @itv be with #Podolski during his speech ü§î
So @ITV footy analysts kept talking when @Podolski10 was giving his goodbye msg. For the sake of others who understand German, shut up pls.
@ITV commentators need to show some respect to @Podolski10 ; let him have his moment while you keep talking over him üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Whys there a German emblem on the screen @ITV ??
@ITV if that's a member of the England squad the moment would have gotten the respect it deserved.
@ITV you've got a world star of football retiring and giggs, wright Dixon and some other guy are all talking shite about Defoe
@ITV could you please be quiet for a moment and tell us what #poldi is saying. Or that we can at least hear what he is saying??!! #lastmatch
@JevdetOrgen @ITV Sorry yes Jevdet, I knew it didn't look right üòÖ
Oh dear that tool @markpougatch is presenting the football o  @ITV  He just said i hope Podolski doesnt sing ? Why would he sing
@ITV need to sort out your commentators. It's a big moment in football with Podolski retiring and the commentary team are just chatting shit
.@ITV No need to be disrespectful about Germany giving some praise to Podolski....
@ITV put some respek on podolski name
@ITV just because your presenters can't speak German doesn't mean they should ignore and talk over the moment. It's a bit disrespectful imo
wow @ITV you wouldn't of thought anything had happened to day judging by you lot of cunts on the england game
@sypickle365 @ITV Use TVplayer mate. 10x better
#GERENG Touching ceremony for a legend of the modern game, but he's not British so @ITV pundits keep talking. I guess only Brits matter?
Very disrespectful @ITV sports commentators. This is @Podolski10 's farewell celebration, just shut up for a moment.
