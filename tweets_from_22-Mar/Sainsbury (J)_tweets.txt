@sainsburys @MandSnews You lot can't even spell taramosalata. And don't get me started on Greek salad. I don't expect anything to change.
@sainsburys no sorry, they were only available last Easter. Not seen them since. Just wondering if they were going to be back this Easter 🐣
@sainsburys thank you will give them a try again - we tried a few weeks ago and no-one has come back to us :(
@sainsburys To be frank, @MandSnews do the same. I think all British supermarkets do. Lamb just seems Greeker than what Greeks actually do.

@sainsburys No it doesn't. Fruit juice "drink" is not pure "juice" which is what you usually sell. Have you stopped selling proper juice?
