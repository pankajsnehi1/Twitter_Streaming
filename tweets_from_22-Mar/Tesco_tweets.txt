@thetimes well done @tesco. " #brexit killed my cat" type headlines are becoming tiresome.

@asda @Tesco @sainsburys I would pay a little more for milk if I could be sure that the full amount I pay extra goes to farmers
@Tesco It's disappointing as had to pay for delivery and wait for it, and now I've got to wait even longer for it as it's broken. Not happy!
@Tesco v disappointed that you didn't bother to tell loyal customers about new charges to click &amp; collect. Not happy.
@Tesco I returned the product to the store, they did a product report and said they would send it to head office. Reference: 2028775210

@Tesco you haven't responded...
@Tesco yep hit me at the dms
@Tesco Course will do. Oh and good on you re the response to Heineken. Good to see you're more for supporting British breweries :)
@Tesco 1/2 there a very few, if any pasta snacks/ salads and sandwiches available, even at 7:30am. Cds and dvds etc are often out of stock
@Tesco 1/2 chilled juices was none available, very little milk, very little chilled fruit/ veg. Very little fresh bread. Often in mornings
@Tesco The Gladstone Tesco in Bow. Always the place to go if you want reduced stickers that don't scan or don't cover the original barcode.
@tesco can you DM me? just seen someone trying to trap a machine at one of your stores.

Well done Jo. Personally I choose to use an alternative supermarket. It's your loss @Tesco https://t.co/KB9xUDPcDD
@Tesco another valid point Paul. This has been great TT (Tesco Team). I'm a big fan of you guys, have a 24hr round the corner. It's great.
@Tesco if this is how you deal with a serious dangerous matter then I have no faith in Tesco to handle my shopping needs.
@Tesco BUT WHY SHOULD I.  YOU WROTE TO ME AND PUT A ¬£5 GIFT CARD IN !!!! RESOLUTION SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED THEN  NOT NOW.  RUBBISH
@Tesco I used to be able to book a delivery order and get it the next day, now you're always full for the best part of a week in advance !
@Tesco across the road from whiteleys
@Tesco the big one
@Tesco 2/2 I have no intention of calling  I played my part by returning it to you  48 hrs to rectify this to a sensible level poor service
@Tesco please sort your grocery delivery services out
@Tesco what at my expense along with my fuel and my time returning the metal contaminated food?  I think Tesco should be rectifying this 1/2
@Tesco 2/2     Fuelled me.  I shall seek advice and see what consumer groups think along with press
@Tesco had there been a sensible response I would let matters rest thinking you took it seriously. Now the derisory compensation has 1/2
@Tesco to discuss what ? Why should it be a battle? Why such poor response why haven't Tesco behaved better or do I need to shout louder ?
@Tesco the more I think of this the more insulted I am.  Returning it to you cost me more in time and fuel. Cheapens a genuine issue Rubbish
