@RoyalMail 3 different times we've had a missed parcel card at the door, each time my retired father has been in - no knock at door, no bell
@RoyalMail crap services in Leyton I'm so fed up with having to contact your helpline for missing parcels. Do something about it.

@benevans78 @LondonMarathon @RoyalMail I am jealous of this mail in whatever state! Not long now!
@BMW please can you advise why your ebay shop finds it so difficult to post to Guernsey? you are aware the @RoyalMail can post here?
Found my @LondonMarathon registration form loose on my doormat. No packaging, no magazine. Just a nice dirty footprint on it! @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail "tried" to deliver parcel today-yet I was watching tv in the living room (front of my house!)- no card was left either??? ü§îü§îü§•ü§•
When you know that @RoyalMail are holding your fab new dress but the hours you're working means you can't go and pick it up! x
@USPSHelp @RoyalMail agreed on both counts. Though your respective systems need synchronization glitches addressed it seems..  @RoyalMail
Hi @RoyalMail, our neighbours (luckily) cam round this evening with a parcel they've had for nearly a week. No card left. Not good enough!
For comparison. 3kg, 80mm x 310mm x 710mm
You're welcome!

@AlexanderLevin Moms are important! 
USPS doesn't operate outside of the US, so @RoyalMail takes care of the final leg of delivery. ^MBL

Gone to the dogs @RoyalMail
@Chorley_Mon @RoyalMail shocking service that pal
@RoyalMail do you have offices in South Africa

@RoyalMail sick to death with you. Two parcels say "address inaccessible" today  and has a complete separate DO to my town on tracking.
@RoyalMail postie takes mail home overnight and manager can't contact him because no number and no need for manager to wait for his return?
@RoyalMail so the fact he stood all over my garden plants and was completely rude isn't something to report?
@fr13day @RoyalMail and it seems like their still losing stuff our Claires parcel disappeared perhaps MG  had something to do with it.

@liggyw This is nice to hear. Have you let @royalmail know as they deliver the mail? - Jess
@RoyalMail @Stormzy1 gutted if they don't sort it
Either @RoyalMail or Townsend music where I got @Stormzy1 tickets have misplaced my tickets or not sent them, now both are refusing to help

@RoyalMail yes it did and it has been delivered and signed for but no one can tell me where https://t.co/Pw8hs79ksE
@RoyalMail this only ever happens with Royal Mail, other couriers have no problem delivering to us, would like some answers
@RoyalMail and where's my card!? It's no where to be found, you've not even bothered to attempt to deliver it... not happy
@RoyalMail specifically WFH today to collect my order and you don't even ring the door bell, all I get is a text to say you've left a card

@missmayawolff You'll need to raise this with @royalmail as they deliver the mail. - Jess
@RoyalMail will my re-delivery item come at a different time to my ordinary post? Are re-deliveries made by a different postman?
@RoyalMail Are you able to track a package for me as it won't show me any details on your website. Was meant to get it 4 days ago from EBay.
@RoyalMail can you use post boxes for click&amp;drop international large letters?

@beckie_finch @RoyalMail @ASOS that's really bad!
@RoyalMail yes I'll give it a try
@RoyalMail @PostOffice Yes sorry. Wrong twitter handle. Not sure if that branch is a franchise or run direct by @RoyalMail but it's v good
@RoyalMail ok thanks. It's just I didn't get any slips through the letterbox or anything. Do I have to pick it up or can I pay for delivery?
@RoyalMail is there a way I can DM you please as I do not wish to express my anger publicly.
@RoyalMail care to enlighten me why my parcel that was sent before last collection on Monday is still sat awaiting collection?
@RoyalMail would be helpful if your couriers actually knocked and attempted to deliver parcels instead of just posting the red slipüëçüèº
@RoyalMail well that isn't going to happen now
@RoyalMail I opened the door and said hello and he said nothing step on the plants to get to my door, handed me the parcel and walked away

NEVER using @RoyalMail to return @ASOS packages again. ¬£120 worth of stuff lost!! Been told if I claim I can only get ¬£50 compensation!!!
@RoyalMail yes on numerous occasions, different response every time. How can only the driver know where something has been delivered
@RoyalMail Can I get a more formal response that I can use when communicating with my lawyers and the Home Office?
@RoyalMail So there is no way to recover it? And you don't know what happened and why. I appreciate you are sorry but it's not very helpful.
@RoyalMail how do I make a complaint about mail going through the wrong door? üôÑ
@RoyalMail it's been 40 days still no answer back ?
@RoyalMail can you please sort asap

@RoyalMail it appears I can't claim as I'm the recipient, is that right?
@RoyalMail can I claim based on the photographic evidence alone?
@RoyalMail I've already recycled the packaging, it was completely ripped so went straight in the green bag
@RoyalMail I don't think it was malicious, my local postman/services are fantastic.
