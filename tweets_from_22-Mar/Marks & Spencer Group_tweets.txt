@marksandspencer I think the offer is not clear enough. If I compare the way you do it to Boots or Tesco, where all sandwiches, snacks, etc
@marksandspencer apparently the sanny was in the wrong place. It was in the Gyle.
@marksandspencer then I was in today and was careful to pick from the offer, got to the till and it was full price.
@marksandspencer I was in a few days ago and didn't realise the offer was limited to specific sandwiches etc so ended up paying full price.
