@sageuk @OlwenIBI great to talk!

@sageuk W/out diversity of  knowledge &amp; insight, we're missing out greatly. Diversity = an imperative for many reasons! (2/2) #SageAdvice
@sageuk I'm continually disappointed by the lack of diversity on conference panels, in the media and other expert opinion (1/2) #SageAdvice
@sageuk Education in an engaging way.  People are often unaware of their own biases.  Awareness = change #sageadvice
@OlwenIBI @Razzermataz @sageuk absolutely
@Razzermataz @sageuk Absolutely :)
@Razzermataz @sageuk @LeisaDocherty Invite them to take part in discussions - inevitably the perception is, they're not invited! #SageAdvice
@OlwenIBI @sageuk Also, is it ok for me to lob my questions like this? üòÄ
@sageuk Does this job description or policy speak to only one type of applicant? Are we appealing to everyone we could be? #SageAdvice
@OlwenIBI @sageuk What are good ways to engage male allies? #sageadvice @LeisaDocherty
@sageuk Simple changes can make a huge difference - language, for instance - applying a diversity 'lens' to how we communicate #SageAdvice
@sageuk In the first instance, it's about having a strategy and auditing our approach to things like recruitment, promotion #SageAdvice

@sageuk it's simple...it's the equality of women and men in every sense #sageadvice
@sageuk Male counterparts, we're neglecting important ambassadors, leaders &amp; champions for gender equality &amp; diversity (5/5) #SageAdvice
I make the complex simple, so your customers understand and engage with your business. See what I did for @sageuk‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mifpd0D57S
@sageuk Traditionally discussion about gender equality &amp; diversity has centred on women, which is natural, but without our (4/5) #SageAdvice
@sageuk &amp; decision-makers.  Their support &amp; engagement, harnessing diversity &amp; ensuring balance is of critical importance (3/5) #SageAdvice
@sageuk A very important one! in fact I feel they're often neglected in this debate. Without their engagement, change  (1/5) #SageAdvice
@sageuk making diversity a genuine priority, leaders living and breathing it not just talking about it #sageadvice
@sageuk In all its forms, rather than unconsciously deciding about a person's ability based on perceptions or norms (4/4) #SageAdvice
@sageuk Which affects our decisions about other people. It's crucial we become conscious of this &amp; focus on talent (3/4) #SageAdvice
@sageuk For that reason we all need to challenge bias &amp; make change happen. We've been socialised to think certain ways (2/4) #SageAdvice
@sageuk Culture, norms &amp; bias. Lack of diversity / equality didn't happen overnight, it's the sum of stereotyping &amp; norms (1/4) #SageAdvice
@NicoleOHagan1 @sageuk @OlwenIBI yes, and it's proven! #sageadvice
@sageuk diverse perspectives = innovation and better outcomes/decisions . Diversity makes business sense #SageAdvice
Are diverse work places more successful than those which aren't? @sageuk @OlwenIBI @LeisaDocherty #SageAdvice #DIVERSITY
@sageuk Making simple changes to processes, de-biasing / balancing decision-making, will deliver far greater diversity (3/3) #SageAdvice
@sageuk Recruitment &amp; promotion are v. important - are you paying attention to balance / diversity in these processes? (2/3) #SageAdvice
@sageuk 2 key things - awareness and strategy. You don't need to spend lots of money but have simple, effective approaches (1/3) #SageAdvice
