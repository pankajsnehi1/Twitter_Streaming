@danidotx @HSBC i'm so surprised they're saying 10 days, they were biting my hand off to do business...
@danidotx @HSBC i still did end up taking a mortgage out with them but wouldn't trust a word of any mortgage sales person tbh...
@thelasttrumpets @HSBC hmm, we have our own solicitor so they won't be playing any funny games with us there üòÅ
@danidotx @HSBC don't talk to me, give me all this talk about paying solicitors fees, turns out only if its a solicitor of their choice..
@thelasttrumpets @HSBC We don't have time to wait 10 days for an appointment :( were they ok in the end?
@danidotx @HSBC If you go to speak to a mortgage advisor i'm not joking but try and record your conversation, HSBC promised me all sorts

@danidotx @HSBC Can I highly recommend making an appointment to see one of their advisors instead? This is what I did &amp; it was much better!
