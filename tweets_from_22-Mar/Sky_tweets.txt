Moved from @SkyUK to @virginmedia for TV. Worst decision ever made!! 11 months till I can switch back I hope sky will have me back
@SkyLivingHD @SkyUK It seems tonight's #MadamSecretary got pulled as it inc a terrorist attack. It is up on Now TV https://t.co/tcKM4aE2CZ ‚Ä¶
Stop giving me normal TV levels of adverts on Sky Go you wronguns @SkyUK
@DGandyOfficial @SkyUK favorite movie
@SkyUK @SkyLivingHD what is going on with #MadamSecretary tonight? Not shown at scheduled time so have to watch on catchup?
Thanks @SkyUK ...keep these personal touches coming... #feelingvalued #corporatespiel #thatsmyopinion https://t.co/KhI5180zPo
Is there a way to permanently disable the need to have a pin on my @SkyUK TV Box? It's really annoying when watching catch up!!!
@timlukejones @Red_Katana1 @SkyLivingHD @SkyUK Thanks Tim. That's what my wife and I assumed, but was surprised not to see anything about it
Guide says I recorded madam secretary but went to watch it and got criminal minds, @SkyUK  what sorcery is this?
@red_katana1 @skylivinghd @skyuk Thanks, makes sense now
@SkyUK you screwed up your schedule...on Sky Living+1 right is showing Criminal Minds @11pm instead of Madame Secretary !!!!
@_hisgrace_ @skyuk Phew I‚Äôm not alone or going mad
@timlukejones @mikejreich @SkyLivingHD @SkyUK actually when you sit back and think, that makes sense thank you for the clarification
@mikejreich @Red_Katana1 @SkyLivingHD @SkyUK cancelled because of events in London
@SkyUK OMFG! so stressed,my update to sky Q means I Can't watch anything without having to guess every sentence or word!worse than ever!
@SkyUK - why does my internet keep dropping to the point its virtually unusable?
@shift3response @SkyUK I'm still waiting the M&amp;S vouchers for when I signed up 4 years ago. They've prob gone to Title First Name
@Action_by_HAVOC @SkyUK I've changed my account to F.Williams. That'll make them sit up
2 days in and impressed with #skyQ minibox also works likes a charm....shout to engineer too, nice guy and excellent service. @SkyUK
@SkyUK I got an offer for a free upgrade on sky+ box I followed the link and ordered. When will it arrive?
@SkyUK possible bug with the latest update? Loving the voice search though! Take that Virgin. https://t.co/iDSEoLmZU5
@SkyUK Thanks for the new V004 #SkyQ software. Interesting tweaks to the EPG. Unfortunately its broken my #UHD service! Black screens agogo!
@SkyUK @BBCBreaking @jonsnowC4 First terrorist attack since #LeeRigby was murder of #JoCox https://t.co/I6KIGWQ0lg
@SkyUK worst service ever
@SkyUK + playback, for me, is the worst ever facility created, a source of massive irritation and frustration üí©
@J_madaxe @SkyUK I'm having the exact same thing! Have done for over a day now
@Red_Katana1 @SkyLivingHD @SkyUK Same question!
Hey @SkyUK, any chance you extend my free box sets offer so I can finish mad men. Still got 2 seasons to go... ü•É
@nataliesawyer @SkyUK        Thank you  Natalie
Thinking of getting Sky Q..? Don't. üòÇ Unless you fancy resetting 3 boxes every few days. Can I just watch the TV now please?! @SkyUk #help!
@SkyUK Where's Madam Secretary??
@SkyUK have the deleted programmes in my sky q gone as a result of the update? Had plenty of room for them. Thanx
@SkyUK rolling out new voice control features for #Skyq when they can't even get box sets to go for more than a few days without crashing
@SkyUK LivingHD now is not madam secretary?! :-(
Great 2nd time in a week #SkyQ isn't working @SkyUK can't wait to see the back of it and go back to HD
@SkyLivingHD @SkyUK where's #MadamSecretary gone is it on tonight at all? #confused
WTF @SkyUK! You are seriously making me use Internet Explorer for Sky Go. Get this sorted out ASAP. #Luddites
@SkyUK why are channels that used to be available no longer available ? https://t.co/bMwFKkz6Ts
@SkyUK why no madam secretary tonight on sky living HD? And why apparently being shown on sky living +1?
@SkyUK Now resolved. The sky supplied HDMI cable is now dead and buried.
@SkyUK Why aren't you loyal to customers who've been loyal to you? Your offers for existing customers are no where near as good as new ones!
@SkyUK your wifi is unimaginably poor - the signal barely reaches either end of the house. Can/will you do anything before I cancel?
@SkyUK just found the voice activation button on the Q remote.
Well played lads! Well played!
The voice activation feature on the @SkyUK remote is class, just when I couldn't get an lazier

@SkyUK Sky Go has stopped working with Isle of Man iP addresses. I've checked this with friends... If I us a vpn to a UK iP its fine.

@SkyUK how quickly can you get set up on tv and broadband when you join sky?
@claireskeet @Carly2222 @SkyUK Sky use the BT line so I'm hoping that going to infinity will be better than our standard "slow" broadband.
I'll reiterate, @SkyUK stick your broadband shield up your hole and your broadband.

@SkyUK phoned your customer line on Monday, told you are very busy so use sms or fb messenger which I did and get no reply. Poor service
@SkyUK pity not all Sky Q users will get this, only those with the higher rate box, pity I wasn't given the options when I upgraded
@mattletiss7 @SkyUK  your losing it man.
