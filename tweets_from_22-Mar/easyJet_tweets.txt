@easyJet  If may passport is out of date, but new is not ready yet. can check in for flight with old data, and change data later w-out fee?
@helenaprestes @easyJet Yes, so,etc,es when you arrive first you can, when you arrive last &amp; flight is full you can't, as explained on site
@easyJet I get that, but we were told the first 100 get there bags on and we still had people coming on with luggage like ours.

Thank you @easyJet for moving us swiftly to a new plane for Marrakesh due to a technical fault. Hopefully on our way soon.

Not the first time have had problems with @easyJet . Paris flight cancelled at 2 hour notice in June. ¬£250 Eurostar later offered ¬£3 sorry üôÑ
@easyJet Still no news, what's going on? Really bad customer service. I'll try tagging @easyJet_press and see if they pay attention.
@easyJet I had a problem with a return flight have a family thing that changed by a few hours and I need a later flight Tuesday. #Pleasehelp
Planes have had to be changed. 100 plus passengers stuck on bus . No apologies. Hugely damaging to reputation @easyJet

@easyJet still no bags, called Luton for them to say our missing report was never filed, run around by the courier company. It's terrible.
@easyJet my bags were lost from flight EZY2298 last week. That happens, I know but since then I've received terrible customer service.
So let me get this straight @easyJet, you've #delayed my #flight by TWO HOURS and yet expect me to check in @ the original time?! EZY8944
