@Mike_Thommo @theCCCuk @BP_plc Certainly not giving up but forecast has to be grounded in possibility. W/O big change, outcome v unlikely.
@IanDuncanMEP @theCCCuk @BP_plc So there's work to do, but let's not give up yet!
@Mike_Thommo @theCCCuk @BP_plc growth in electric sector not enough. Relative share of electric üöó in Scotland actually falling year on year.
@IanDuncanMEP @theCCCuk @BP_plc Don't agree: already range of EV models, 2018 cars will have 200-mile range, rapid charge network expanding
@Mike_Thommo @theCCCuk @BP_plc Problem elements required to deliver this outcome are unlikely even in med term
@IanDuncanMEP @theCCCuk @BP_plc
But of course will need strong policy push alongside technological progress
@IanDuncanMEP @theCCCuk @BP_plc Interesting thanks. Still:
-Net zero needs zero car CO2
-All EVs poss for Scot by 2050
-Big AQ benefits
