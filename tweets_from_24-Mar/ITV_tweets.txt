Loving the #nightly show so much with @dermotoleary It should be extended to an hour. 1/2 before news and other 1/2 after @ITV
@BoxToffee @PaulMalignaggi @NigelGBenn @ITV brutal fight a classic in English lor
@IMPACTWRESTLING @HeelTeam6_CHEF @ITV @WOSWrestlingITV What @WOSWrestlingITV ?
Loving the #nightlyshow on @ITV now that @dermotoleary is presenting. Dec's right, he should be given the show full time.
@russellthevoice @thismorning @ITV Keiko - I watched it on Russell Forum.  Sandra posted the You Tube link.
@IMPACTWRESTLING @ITV @WOSWrestlingITV This Will Be Pretty EPIC! #MakeImpactGreat #IMPACTonPOP
@ITV @itvnews News at 10, one night special then we'll move it back to 10:30..
@ukrokuchannels @BBC @ITV @BritBox_US @RokuPlayer Just got it yesterday:)
@MadameCupcakes @ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV 100% agree and doesn't think he needs to talk about sex, swear etc to be funny.üíñüëèüëç
@ITV @ITVNightlyShow Dermot should either be full time or at least a regular...from the same wonderful mould as Ant &amp; Dec. Hilarious &amp; clean
@ITV @ITVNightlyShow Dermot is a national treasure,naturally hillarious, who doesn't swear, refer to sex or put people down to try &amp; b funny
@ITV @alienfuncapsule we all used to do that back when I was young, shouting "MULE TRAIN!!!!!!!!"

@ITV wtf is going on. I was just in the middle of an intriguing episode of a touch of frost on itv 3 +1 and it just stopped at midnight!!
@ITV what is the point of having ITV3+1? Cuts into one programme at 6pm and cuts out half way through another at midnight.
@antanddec @ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @ITV are u kidding me ! Y did I not read this earlier??
