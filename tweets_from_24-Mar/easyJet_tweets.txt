@easyJet absolute joke! Oversold your flight and now on stand by to BCN with mum in tears. How can you do this?! Booked flights in Dec!
@JKav87 and making changes with @easyJet is more expensive than the flight was in the first place #cheers #robbery
@easyJet final boarding call liv/mad. All passengers stuck past passport control. About 15 seats to wait and plane still being cleared. Meh
@easyJet j'ai toujours pas compris la raison pour laquelle c'est plus de 300 CHF apr√®s P√¢ques et apr√®s les vacances scolaires

@easyJet I just can't believe how poor your communication is during your booking process. No where did it say if you don't check in online
@easyJet absolutely appalled at your systems. You oversold our flight &amp; I'm now travelling by myself while my partner waits for however long
