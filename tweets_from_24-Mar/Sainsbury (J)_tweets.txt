Proud of @sainsburys for raising £11.5m for #comicrelief #RedNoseDay 🔴❤️🔴❤️ https://t.co/0piFioVd7B
@Tesco @sainsburys https://t.co/e7qS3NBiDL
@Tesco a waste of time.Found it when rang HO for directions.Get home and my bananas were this size #tiny and green. Off to @sainsburys now!
@sainsburys Robert?! Who are you??? What's happened to Daryl?? Look all I want is reimbursed and to put this horrible episode behind me
@Naanster @sainsburys Thanks!
@nasalvin @sainsburys to shop at more reasons?
Second time I could not use my @nectar points at @sainsburys what is the point of collecting them if I cannot use them!
@sainsburys I've seen it quite a few times now
@Farbeque @sainsburys

More reasons...
@Naanster @sainsburys ooh yes, chicken tikka would be scrummy x
@sainsburys It was Peterborough,Oxney Rd. Perhaps a secret buttercream thief lurkes in the fruit and veg isle #angelcakegate
@Tesco #unreliable #disappoint home delivery services, hardly a surprise from Tesco. #whereismyorder #switching to @sainsburys
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys but you're complaint about bad service? Maybe that person has had a shit day?
@sainsburys are you an auto tweet? Why can't you find the store I named?
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys you're moaning about service, you can't tell me (your sister) you have never been rude to a customer?
@sainsburys going to tesco from now on, sainburys was just closer
@sainsburys I go your shop every day, but this time I wasn't allowed in because you were "closed". Even tho it was 5 to 11, and shuts at 11.
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys no, not saying that but, you'll go back, so your tweet is irrelevant?
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys I mean, you will return to Wantage sainsburys even though you received bad service yes?
@comicrelief #comicrelief2017  @TtrainChester  well done. Superb time @sainsburys Wrexham https://t.co/iNRbziNcCo
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys because you're complaining about one bad service at sainsburys, yet you'll return will you not?
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys you're boring
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys you crying because of bad service, get it everywhere mate
@ThomasDavidPill @sainsburys you complaining
@sainsburys ..on bread and other essentials. Thank you.

@sainsburys Large group of people up to no good (about 9pm this evening)
@sainsburys You might want to pay more attention to what's going on in the car park at your Bracknell branch on Bagshot Road.
Dear @sainsburys can you open a store near Canons Park, HA7 please. Tesco Express have the monopoly and they are lazy and rubbish.
@FunkyVoicesFans @sainsburys @YouTube hope you raised loads!
@choralhour @sainsburys Thanks! Sure we will, we are a little bit crazy!!
You must be kidding me @sainsburys https://t.co/52EI09Vj6c
