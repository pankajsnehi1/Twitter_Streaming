@SkyUK moved into new house &amp; there's a sky dish &amp; loads of cables inside we don't need, who do we speak to to get them removed? Thanks :)
@jk_rowling @comicrelief  that's great news! How about @SkyUK donating profits from the film downloads? #RedNoseDay
@SkyUK BEST ADVERT EVER.... you gotta feature Lego Batman all the time! ‚ò∫
@SkyUK I've been phoned by an Indian call centre claiming to be the Sky "refund centre" - sounds like a scam. Thought you should know.
@virginmedia yes problems in my area however as an individual I've had issues none stop with bad wifi and slow set too box @SkyUK
@SkyUK useless skyq box keeps crashing and losing picture. Completely unresponsive, any chance of some money back for not been able to watch

Be aware anyone with SkyQ if you leave @SkyUK your dish won't work on Freesat and you will need to pay to have it sorted #awful #custserv
@sasso_v @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam Which is exactly why I'm going to cancel today and get an IPTV box for ‚Ç¨300/year.
@SkyUK why no series link available for new f1 season . Having to record them all manually üò≤üò≤üò≤
@SkyUK hi are you planning on bringing #gameofthrones back to boxsets ahead of the new series?
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK Your customer service is exceptional! Well done from a happy customer! Special thanks to Phil from upgrades. üëèüèªüëèüèª

So, to get UHD on @SkyUK you need the most expensive box and a 'Multiscreen subscription'. Why not call it a bandwidth charge?
Can't wait to cancel @SkyUK once my contract is up!
.@SkyUK since when did you start deciding what I wanted to watch? Please don't mess about adding different shows to the same series link.
Char I don't like leaves Blacklist- hurrah! 'cept @SkyUK decide his new show's part of series link. Deleted it - now actual series link gone
Just paid @virginmedia ¬£240 to cancel a contract I never knew I had #duped What you got going on @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam #believeinbetter
@SkyUK ordered a replacement remote 16 days ago - no sign of it! Is it walking its way to me?
@BBCNews @Ofcom @BBCWorld @SkyUK would owe me over ¬£100 under this system. Partly due to failings with @bt_uk Openreach as well
@VodafoneUKhelp I left, paid full and final, now with @SkyUK. You can DM me and go to the effort you should in this instance?
@AntonisPetrides @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam that is very poor service. Doesn't feel I get good value for mine either and I pay ¬£80/month

@SkyUK Quick question, can you record live TV in UHD? Have @SkySportsF1 coverage set to record but will it automatically save the UHD feed?
Enjoying the new voice control on Sky Q what wonderful technology, the best tv in the UK @SkyUK
How many times will @SkyUK call me today? Completely pointless exercise as they will come bo were near the deal I have with @bt_uk
@BTCare @bt_uk ARE A SHAMBLES. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NEW PROVIDER, DO NOT USE BT. @SkyUK what deals have you got?

@SkySportsF1 @SkyUK Stop using SilverLight so I can use Sky Go. Wouldnt use IE if you paid me. I pay you, though will stop if no HTML5 soon
@SkyHelpTeam It's the principle! @SkyUK shud not take more money when they already owe me. Am out of pocket for a month. Not fair.Not happy!
@SkyUK ¬£27 a month to watch Formula 1 is a complete joke! Cannot wait until my contract is up. I'm off! #SkyF1 #Formula1
