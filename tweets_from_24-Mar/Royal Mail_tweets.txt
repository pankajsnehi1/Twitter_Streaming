@RoyalMail so you lost my package?
@Mollymoo48 You would need to tweet @RoyalMail about this directly as they deliver the mail. ~ Luke
@RoyalMail your website is off, i need track my order
@RoyalMail you need to check your staff, someone's obviously ripped my card in half to check for money. Glad there wasn't any in there!!üò°
what chance you got when @RoyalMail say they posted a card through my door to say they couldn't deliver because property was inaccessible? üòë
@RoyalMail I sent a parcel yesterday (next day delivery) from Truro to Newcastle. After 24 hours it has only reached Exeter #royalfail

@alliejademann @RoyalMail they delivered my phone to o2 damaged, thankfully I insured the package, they'll be getting ask for ¬£100
@AskeBay @RoyalMail Its not as easy to sell on eBay as it is to buy if the Royal Mail has closed down your local Post Office!
@RoyalMail been waiting for it for days and it was lazily pushed through instead of a quick knock on the door. really disappointed.
@RoyalMail thanks for being shit
@RoyalMail hey I got a print delivered and it was stuffed through my letterbox and now it's all crumpled-not my or the sellers' fault
@RoyalMail  i would like to know how much an hour you pay your postmen ,because i get posted half the streets letters
@RoyalMail he has done this...
@RoyalMail can you teach your posties numbers and letters in St Helens ,sick of receiving half the neighbourhoods post
@RoyalMail Hi, someone's opened my post again. Can you please look into this. At least second time since last year. @NUJofficial
@badgerwatcher1 @RSPCA_official @RoyalMail To be fair I'd imagine proving rubber band ownership would be impossible. Education is key here
@PostOffice @RoyalMail sorry for the mistake, thanks for you're reply
@RoyalMail just wondered as it says sales order raised
@Mr_C_C_ I believe you've confused us with @RoyalMail as we don't deliver any mail. ~ Luke
@RoyalMail pretty poor, post doesn't arrive at all some days, after 6pm on other days; and today we got a "fee to pay" card dated yesterday!
So angry at @RoyalMail they loose signed for items and then have someone read of script replies and then disconnect. Brilliant service.
@RoyalMail Thanks but why "DELIVERY ATTEMPTED UNKNOWN DELIVERY REASON" ? The shipper told me that he still not received parcel
Lovely @Debenhams Mother's Day bouquet arrived. Thank you to postie @RoyalMail who got it over my tall gate w/o dam‚Ä¶ https://t.co/VVJGjrd4hR

Hey @royalmail we've had no post since Tuesday, inc subscriptions we expect. Neighbours have been fine. Can you help?! Thanks!
@RoyalMail Followed.
@RSPCA_official @EmmaJLarge If its @RoyalMail bands, cant you presecute them?
@RoyalMail absolutely useless! item should've been delivered today, item arrived at the Sheffield depot 2am lastnight but hasn't left since!
@RoyalMail still no email from the escalation team as promised, to explain why my post was delayed for 3 months. What else can I do?
@RoyalMail I hope you are prepared to pay for the financial losses my husband will suffer b/c of your inability to understand "guaranteed".
@RoyalMail I wouldn't want to have to force an apology. I was promised a call to explain how it happened. It really is pointless now
@RoyalMail I chose Special delivery because they were extremely time sensitive.
@RoyalMail I hope someone is going to pay for the 30 minute phone call? Please advise who to send the bill to üò° #angryandletdown
@RoyalMail no card left, called you as advised online, held for 30 minutes for an advisor to be cut off at 6pm as you've all gone home?!!
@RoyalMail delivered, yay!
@royalmail how long does it take to get back undelivered Special Delivery items? You didn't deliver my house purchase documents today.
@RoyalMail on its way? Excellent. That's what I wanted to know, thanks!

@RoyalMail Why is this taking so long??
@RoyalMail once again the worse delivery service on the plant. Next day delivery obviously means somthing different to you! #worstcompany
@RoyalMail thanks for your reply, as my wife would tell you I am premature again! The package arrived around 40 mins after the tweet, sorry
@RoyalMail can you dm me so I can confirm the address that should be on the package for you?
@RSPCA_official @badgerwatcher1 @RoyalMail Wish people would care!
@AmazonHelp I would accept that if it wasn't being delivered by @RoyalMail - they don't deliver up until 9pm!
@RoyalMail update please? RO983223541GB
@RoyalMail Unfortunately not, it was sent second class with delivery due either yesterday or today.
@badgerwatcher1 @EmmaJLarge @RoyalMail We repeatedly call for people to pick up littered elastic bands, but sadly carelessness continues.
@RoyalMail an accurate, publicly available database of postbox locations and collection times can't be too much to ask surely?
@RoyalMail I men the company obviously, not the person behind the twitter screen.
@EmmaJLarge Whats really annoying, is that @RoyalMail dont seem to care.Why are @RSPCA_official not doing more to stop it?
@RoyalMail yeah I'm guessing
@RoyalMail yes, no thanks to you...
@RoyalMail no luck. They said it is not yet back at the office despite the delivery attempt at 10am
@RoyalMail this is getting a bit daft now! Every item I posted at same time has updated but one!

@RoyalMail Paying extra for tracking is paying twice for you to do a job that I have already paid you to do ! Do you monitor loses from PO's
@RoyalMail Why is the redirect service so rubbish? Why am I now being charged an extra ¬£2 per item? Why can't you get it right? Not happy!
@RoyalMail all the road wants our old postman back, I can understand moving ones with complaints but not ones that do the best job
@RoyalMail yes I understand the process but that doesn't really help. At what point do you take responsibility I handed it to your employee
@RoyalMail is there an email address to see about moving a post box?
@RoyalMail also the email reply I got even got my address wrong! Fucking useless.
@RoyalMail Tracking says it's ready for delivery today but still hasn't come
Seriously what's with postbox collections at 9am @RoyalMail ?? On a mercy dash to get mine and a neighbour's Mother's Day cards to postbox!
@RoyalMail, I ordered parcel on Mon that was dispatched Tue and est delivery today still waiting, tracking reference number not recognised
@RoyalMail is first class now 10 days? Also how do I go about claiming for this package?
@RoyalMail hi i cant find the right option
@SuperSizeArt @RoyalMail I'll second that.
@RoyalMail the pbm is you only have one service desk at the end of a narrow corridor. The whole process &amp; location needs a re-think
@RoyalMail next Friday
@RoyalMail so why should it be delivered? It was medication I checked with the post office before i sent it and he said it was fine??
@RoyalMail yes, although helpful I'm in strong doubt my parcel will arrive tomorrow as there is nobody to contact!

@RoyalMail Requested redelivery of parcel. No sign of it yet despite postman and postvan already delivering. Where can I get an update?
@RoyalMail When will it be deemed lost? A week for 1st cls delivery is a long time. It was a mothers day gift that my customer now won't get
@RoyalMail it was only small but that shouldn't matter. The value of it was only ¬£1 but the person is getting on to me
@RoyalMail surely the postman would empty the postbox? Doesn't look very good on me when someone has brought something though does it?
@RoyalMail Thanks, I can't seem to find 'progressing through our network' in the glossary of terms or when this means I'll receive my post

@RoyalMail is it normal for parcels to be put into outside bins when you miss a delivery?

I went to send an A4 Mothers Day to Cardiff &amp; was told it'd be ¬£12. Fuckinell @RoyalMail I could get myself to Cardiff &amp; back for ¬£15.
@RoyalMail is it now a standard thing for parcels to be left on the doorstep? I have experienced this a number of times now...
@RoyalMail Can we have our old postman back please? He has been our morning smile for years! Just heard he has been move to W14.
@RoyalMail IT SAYS ROYAL. MAIL.
@RoyalMail are you sure? https://t.co/ad7Owt2mTt
@RoyalMail small thing but annoying. Greetings card (for mother's day) clearly says do not bend, but postie ignores‚Ä¶ https://t.co/kmYwaZerUT
@RoyalMail are a disgrace, no respect for people's post, I'm not happy my card bent in the middle, it's a Mother's Day card, ignorant idiot
@RoyalMail what support is available for staff at work who feel unsupported when following set policy ?  #fair #equality
@RoyalMail why do your employees find the need to bend a card which clearly says DO NOT BEND, it easily fits in letterbox üò°üò°üò°
@RoyalMail thanks so much
Absolutely disgusted with @RoyalMail , had a card delivered saying do not bend, it's only a normal size card, postman bent it in half üò°üò°
@RoyalMail I posted an important doc (signed for on delivery) on 11/03 &amp; it's still not been posted.why is it taking so long?
@RoyalMail Hi my friend shipped some stuff without tracking number. So can i pay more and get tracking number?
@RoyalMail why do you deliver post after 5pm at the end of the working day?
@RoyalMail I'd love to but how am I supposed to provide proof of postage for each item if they're all on same receipt?
@RoyalMail @MoonpigUK  It's  obviously a card and politely asks don't bend, so don't ram it through the letterbox!‚Ä¶ https://t.co/4JxwqKOfVQ
@RoyalMail why was my confidential mail delivered to a different address and not taken back to the sorting office
@RoyalMail Paid for forwarding to be set up and important documents not been forwarded so sent to old address. What can you do about it?
@PaulNicholsonGo @RoyalMail people are scared to go to work. It's happened seemingly overnight. What is the end goal treating ppl like that?
@PaulNicholsonGo @RoyalMail ridiculous. My friend works there. Sacking people with no warning. Have to ask to go toilet. Can't drink coffee
@masseffect @RoyalMail @AmazonUK Update: It has just arrived in today's post. Not sure what happened yesterday, but thanks for your helpüëç
@RoyalMail  My parcel must be stuck at Heathrow Worldwide DC as it left the sender land. Would you be able to check? RV206361609ES.
@RoyalMail great. Who has to do this then the sender?
@RoyalMail @royalmailnews @RoyalMailGroup still waiting....50 minutes????
@RoyalMail  Useable yes but as it was the David Bowie stamp pack not very collectable now
@RoyalMail I can get my number to work, my issue is with the wording. It's not language your users understand. The information is useless üôÉ

@FindMeAJobNI Hi, this is a Royal Mail parcel. You can reach them via @RoyalMail, kind regards-Stephen
Das ist ja saucool, @GLS_Germany hat die Trackingnummer von @RoyalMail √ºbernommen und ich wei√ü, wo mein Paket ist. Sollte Standard werden.
@Cityboy43 It IS standard procedure for uncancelled stamps, though they also have a device https://t.co/7js4ZYsFS0 but 2yrs on? @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail after getting 15 month old ready 2 collect it from depot it is hanging in my letterbox?! Does some1 need retraining on tracking?
@RoyalMail I'm confused at to why my letter was delivered like this https://t.co/yL5iVvfcGn
@RoyalMail I know that, I was asking if I can request to change it before it is delivered! Or even to leave it with a neighbour?
@RoyalMail can you follow me so we can DM as this is urgent &amp;needs to be resolved in the next 7 days otherwise a complaint will be logged
@RoyalMail by the 17/4 we will be in Australia so this needs to be resolved before we leave Indonesia.
@RoyalMail we need a realistic delivery date? Obviously 5-7 days is incorrect. What is our next step? Who can I speak to?
@RoyalMail take responsibility for the mountain of elastic bands littering our streets. Pose a real danger to animals!@badgerwatcher1
@RoyalMail we are awaiting on a phone and bank card in that parcel so paid extra for it to be tracked and signed for! Very unhappy.
@RoyalMail why the 17th? We were given a time scale of 5-7 days 2 weeks ago when it was posted. We leave Indonesia in 7 days
@RoyalMail I have dm'd you have you got it?
@RoyalMail yes thanks
@RoyalMail What the sodding hell does this even mean? https://t.co/n2UvxX6o6X
