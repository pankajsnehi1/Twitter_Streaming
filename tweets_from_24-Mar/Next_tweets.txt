@dresserman @nextofficial @PaulHalliwell @scottleather7 @MonksRachel https://t.co/skXSu6rEKX
@nextofficial there's no delivery dates available for Sunday, Monday the latest!? What's going on!?
@nextofficial ordered Monday a Mothers Day present, 4pm today you advise not sent, live nowhere near my Mum, only child #massiveletdown
@JimMcCauley @nextofficial I was on safari. Still not working and not in a position to call at the moment .
@Retailathlete @nextofficial @PaulHalliwell @scottleather7 @MonksRachel a wise woman.
@dresserman @nextofficial @PaulHalliwell @scottleather7 exactly what my sister said! @MonksRachel
@nextofficial I have DM
@nextofficial @Retailathlete @PaulHalliwell @scottleather7 brown shoes eh?
@scottleather7 @nextofficial @PaulHalliwell ha ha banter is a long game Scott, soon as he ordered the smaller size, booooooom 😂😂
@nextofficial your availability for stock from your catalogue is awful, 11 items all out of stock, same every time, farce
Profits fall @nextofficial and says "a challenging year ahead". What must be done to regain its #Mojo? @retailfocus… https://t.co/T6bJBDX8y3
@Retailathlete @nextofficial @PaulHalliwell 😂😂😂
@nextofficial no it wasn't ready till 14:29 as that was when I received the email, I went to collect at 12:40 pm

With my new jeans, from @nextofficial i might add, you're reading the very best in hardware, software &amp; menswear.
@nextofficial I bought two pair of jeans about a month ago, have barely worn as every time I do my body is dyed black and blue! NIGHTMARE!
@nextofficial or maybe not. https://t.co/H9YpWF1B49
@nextofficial extremely disappointed. https://t.co/lBvESAFvao
@nextofficial Hello, do you know if the set of 4 black and white chevron mugs will be coming back in stock please?
@nextofficial it has been dealt with via your Facebook page.
Dear @nextofficial 

Please replenish your stock, particularly tops, playsuit and jumpsuits.

Kind Regards

Hi @nextofficial any idea why this bedding is 'not available '? Will it be available anytime soon? Thanks! https://t.co/ao4BZHdEMo
@nextofficial bought at Christmas and all my dinner plates already look like this! Surely not fit for purpose?? 😩 https://t.co/cQeXidxSlA
@nextofficial can you reply to this please? Tweeted you 2 days ago!
@nextofficial can you tell me if my delivery has arrive I have pm
@nextofficial 2nd day running delivery driver hadn't turned up?
Love how I paid £90 for a dress from @nextofficial but they'll only refund me £40 as it's now on sale despite my receipt proving I paid £90
@nextofficial I know, that's why I want you to bring it back...please?😭😭😭even just for a day so I can stock up???
@nextofficial so home order wrong again since Nov 16 going on and still no resolution. No response to my complaint not acceptable really!!
@nextofficial yes I did. Spoke to someone  and was told the complaints team would call me.back within 24 hours. That was at 4.pm yesterday.
@nextofficial @UCDDrina I'm having the exact same problem, both on Chrome and Firefox on Windows 10.
I'm finding it hard to live without my trade scent, GOLD. Will it ever come back @nextofficial ?#ScentOfAWoman #CashForGold @NextHelp
@nextofficial promised a phone call within 24 hours.......Still waiting.  They don't mind taking your money
@nextofficial I find it very inconvenient and it has stoped me buying over the past year and I was told sorry about this but we can't help
@nextofficial call pp asking for date of birth,full address, full name, email address"to book deliveries" #dataprotectionirony @metpoliceuk
@nextofficial how can someone try something on without having to purchase it first if you don't stock the size
@nextofficial I've been told in store that NO stores stock above age twelve due to the mannequin size and hangers
@nextofficial I can't order any flowers, it won't let me add a delivery date??
@nextofficial emily in next victoria station is SO nice!! She was so happy and kind. Shame about her train being delayed earlier 😇
@JWils60 @nextofficial Guess they realise that setting our own tariffs is a good idea for their customers. I've never been - my Next trip!
@nextofficial received an email in the morning that it will be ready for collection after 12pm

I hope the flowers I've ordered my mom for Mother's Day are nice 😣 @nextofficial don't let me down like the previous site 🙄😬
@nextofficial how annoying! The school shoes I ordered have been sent, it is not the style or size I ordered!!!
@nextofficial big up your Bentley bridge store for playing Kavinsky-nightcall in store 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Amazing service from @nextofficial! Tell me my item has been lost in transit but they are sending out another with free next day delivery☺️

@nextofficial why do u not stock over 12yrs in store? having 2 order on line pay 4 it just 2 see if it fits &amp; if it don't wait for a refund
@nextofficial do I have to bring ID to collect something? It's in a family members name, is that allowed or would she have to get it herself
@nextofficial dissapointing flower delivery not sure how these look remotely similar.. https://t.co/6vhmMV21im
@nextofficial I have sent you a reply but you need to follow me
Any one got a @nextofficial sofa? Liking the look of the Ophelia extra large or chaise ones? #nexthome #home #decor
@nextofficial not happy with the click n collect service, order was not ready till 12:40pm, had to come back home without it
So @nextofficial and @waitrose have both let me down as they don't deliver flowers to my mum's place in Aberdeenshire.
@nextofficial please could you confirm that's both parcels?

@nextofficial Hi Iv called last night to cancel and order but had no email to confirm. Can you check for me please?
@nextofficial shame, it's the bookcase we wanted. Will have to keep our eyes peeled for it in a sale of some sort #hinthint
@nextofficial have done, thanks 👍🏼
So I've just had a £50 parking fine for spending more than 2 hours walking round @nextofficial @SmythsToysUK @BootsUK and @SportsDirectUK 😞

@nextofficial why has the item ordered on Wed already arrived in store but the item I ordered on Sat can't be collected until next Thurs? 🤔
Ooh - found some lovely things in @nextofficial dress edit for the season ahead https://t.co/fjEVDKzfL8
@nextofficial is the website down at the moment? Saying I'm unable to place an order at this time?
@nextofficial it was approved, but only the following day. My argument is why take orders when nobody is at the bank to approve the loans?
@nextofficial shocking CS!! She states the my application failed... obviously just ignored my whole email!!! https://t.co/juIt3NzLRp

Why are @nextofficial shirts so poorly made considering the cost, stitching is rubbish &amp; colors are broken. Better off with Primark shirts.
