@DirectLine_UK trying to sort with auto glass ATM. Do you use any other glass replacement companies?
@AdmiralUK Like for like, your insurance quotation for our car was nearly 50% MORE than @axainsurance &amp; @DirectLine_UK!
@directline_UK Do you look at Autoglass twitter - poor service
for broken windscreen under policy- seems fairly common experience.
@adriiennexo @DirectLine_UK Great work! Thanks so much!
@DirectLine_UK Wow, 25% increase in our pet insurance, yet never made a claim!! Disgraceful, you expect me to just renew?!?!? #ripoff
