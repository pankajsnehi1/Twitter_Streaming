Good afternoon @AskLloydsBank how does moving your Pendeford call centre to India make you "Best bank for customers'? #concernedcustomer
@AskLloydsBank it's a replacement card for pre-existing account.  Thanks.
@AskLloydsBank mobile internet banking not working on the app, says register, then says already registered, yet desktop site works fine
@AskLloydsBank excellent customer service from Natalie in the call centre I just called. Who ever she is she needs to be commended.

@AskLloydsBank And how would that help @buffy_boyle
@AskLloydsBank the point is more, why ask if it was me, if you were only going to decline. Pointless!

@AskLloydsBank were even rude enough to ask what they expect me to do about?! Seriously?! Money gone, account gone.
@AskLloydsBank even tried to blame @TSB who were very polite about the situation explaining they wouldn't have it! Time to switch banks!
So @AskLloydsBank have informed me there is no trace of my son's account on their system? Even rude enough to ask what I expect them to do!

@AskLloydsBank I opened my account in Loughborough. If I want to close my account, should I send a closing letter to Lloyds in Loughborough?
@AskLloydsBank But why can I still log into Lloyds Bank via Internet banking and see my account? Didn't you get my closing letter?
@AskLloydsBank I sent a closing letter in November 2016 as I remember to Burmingham service centre.
