@Tesco I do have a serious problem with those grapes though. They're the perfect movie night snack. Until. You're 4 punnets in.
@Tesco bloody hell Paul, you just blew my mind. I never thought of freezing them and yet I see that on pinterest all the time.
@Tesco indeed, one might almost be left with the sense that this stretch of road isn't a place to park illegally then, no?!
