So far I've waited 4 months for @TaylorWimpey to fix my fence, getting really pissed of about this @TWimpeySupport
@LeighMurray75 Maybe @TaylorWimpey ought to hire @FozzieBear in their customer care team. I feel a bit calmer after seeing his fuzzy face.
.@TaylorWimpey Is your share price only sign of poor performance? https://t.co/vyGZy1MIzY.

@Jakedrum @TaylorWimpey Too angry for Python. It's that bad. Currently eating dinner in our bedroom as it's the only place we have furniture
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey I hear you, even if they do not. &amp; to pass the time Monty Python: The argument clinic https://t.co/Xntk4IW187
@Jakedrum @TaylorWimpey Yes, but also because they employ the worst customer service people in the world. SO. MUCH. HATE
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey  Is that as in 'Our omnishambles is result of high exec &amp; low labourer wages yet we hide behind "high regs"'?
Went for 'omnishambles' instead. As in '@TaylorWimpey, the fact we still have no furniture at 7pm on a Friday night is an omnishambles'
Never actually been this angry before. Excellent achievement, @TaylorWimpey.
@TaylorWimpey I wish I owned my garden #leaseholdscandal
