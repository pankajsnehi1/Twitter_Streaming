How robotic is the delivery of lines on that @BarclaysUK  advert.. truly awful acting.
@barclays @BarclaysUK most insensitive bank by far when dealing with fraud cases.

@BarclaysUK  Why can I not get a complete summary of my account  statement (from inception to present)?
@BarclaysUKHelp you lot should be locked up, @BarclaysUK #firstplus interest rate scam. Don't bank with these dirty scummy scam artists
@BarclaysUK ATMs don't have Â£10 notes as a default option. U have to do it as a custom selection. Trying to make u feel cheap. #STFU
@BarclaysUK 5/5   You said she didn't need to let you know but it seemed she did. Many more banks with better service than this.
@BarclaysUK 4/5   3 days later marker is lifted so Mum now has cash.   What recompense will you make for stress &amp; inconvenience?
@BarclaysUK 3/5 After much effort ,a fruitless call to Delhi call centre she is told by someone in Liverpool there's a marker on her card
@BarclaysUK 2/5 'as more ppl are travelling'. Jump ahead to Mum in Jaipur. 3 attempts to get cash from ATM, all declined. Mum short of cash
@barclaysUK 1/5 Prior to a trip to India my Mum called your Travel Assistance Dept ahead of her impending trip. 'No need to tell us' you say
@BarclaysUK safe banking?! Haha ok then. I have 2 pingit accounts that I didn't open and Â£600 gone out?! They're a joke

@BarclaysUK online banking has changed. Can I no longer set up a payment for a future date?
@BarclaysUK I finally give up on your banks. No staff, no paying in slips, just generally useless
The evolving sphere of influence with Stephen Doherty from @BarclaysUK at our new event in June https://t.co/2x5SEEK2bK
@BarclaysUK 2/2 internet banking and update address - even though the account is closed. Absolutely disgusted. #Disgraceful #Barclays #Payup
1/2 Wrote to @BarclaysUK about the paid account I was miss-sold. they are now saying my account address is incorrect and I have to log on to
@BarclaysUK @ideal_home_show awful and unhelpful customer service!! Unable to redeem 2-4-1 on tickets. Expiry is 25th on email??! Fake email
2nd key tip following our seminar on 'Investing in Retail Property' hosted with @BarclaysUK #Investing #Retailâ€¦ https://t.co/HEgYHcughs
@BarclaysUK trained properly so they understand how to run a branch is beyond me. Absolute joke when the line is out the door. Embarrassing
@BarclaysUK the fact you can't seem to understand the concept of hiring more staff to solve this problem or getting your managers...
@BarclaysUK can you please explain why I've wasted 30 minutes of my life in your branch because you have only 2 staff on at peak times
Being a @BarclaysUK premier and @BarclaysBizChat client doesn't mean you get access to your biz manager. 40mins of my life wasted today.
@actionfrauduk @BarclaysUK We shouldn't have to, it's up to the banks to make sure their ATM's are safe to use. They don't do enough.
The team from @BarclaysUK did great at the #redstarquiz #lbe2017 #finance thanks for playing guys https://t.co/NQpbDwXa1r
@BarclaysUK what does your online system tell users if they exceed payment limit in a transaction? @HSBC just says 'sorry' so have no clue.
