The ratings plummeted whilst @ThisisDavina was at the helm, so how did she nail it? @ITVNightlyShow @ITV
@Ms_tweetz @ITV Davina McCall is my favourite so far.
@Eley01 @gail99a @subtel1 @DanielM2k18 @Jondollson @ChrisJW1987 Hi shaun, we're good thanks, we just been watching #Broadchurch on @ITV ☺️
@TV_Archive The Video has been Copyrighted by @ITV :(

@Fargie86 @antanddec 😂 oh dear, I'd never thought!! Maybe it is a mask being held up....🤔 can anyone clarify?? #SNT @itvtakeaway @ITV
@ITV @BroadchurchTV come on itv let's have another broad church don't make this the last best program ever 👍
@ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV Brilliant start to the week. Dermey best so far, plus fab guests!
Seriously hope @ITV are gunna get another series of @TheHalcyon made. I miss it so much!
@ITV Are there any plans for a 2nd series of Brief Encounters? Thanks
@Downhilldave1 @ITV Totally agree!
The always awesome Olivia Colman in Broadchurch. Cheer up Miller! #oliviacolman @BroadchurchTV @ITV https://t.co/WgD4CKn6X7

@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV Love it! https://t.co/imDA3adJ5o
@capbyrne @ITV Great idea, i find myself in the same boat when watching itv
Probably @ITV should have hired @GregScottTV from @coastcountydab in #Scarborough to present #thenightlyshow instea… https://t.co/w0s07MS9ju
@itv Surely time to pull the plug on this now, won't be watching this again! #TheNightlyShow #Awful
https://t.co/HgRUvPbPU2  @LBC @DailyMirror @metro @BBCNewsnight @bbc @SkyNews @itv @Channel4News Tom Watson the biggest hypocrite EVER❗️😝
Still a belter of a series, new twists and turns every week!! Enjoy this programme so much. Still one of the best on @ITV #broadchurch
Watch and learn how a talk show should be done @itv. @skyatlantic now. https://t.co/BdK4CqQQQo
@ITVNightlyShow @ITV great show but it's not on long enough! Could have had some great interviews with more time
Watching @Rubywax with @ITV #NightlyShow talking #frazzled Sounds like a plan @Frandommom for @TeamworkTrust #WellbeingHub
@lillybeth1818 @ITV Also zero sense of time or place. Throwing in a few vintage appliances &amp; a bad soundtrack does not a period drama make.
My mind is well and truly boggled.. Broadchurch will be the talking point in the PE office tomorrow! 🕵🏻‍♀️ #whodidit? #broadchurch @ITV 🙈
Fun night ahead with @leahcharlesking. Join us on @ITV from 00:40.
See you tomorrow @radioleary @ITVNightlyShow @ITV 👍
@EmmaAVFC @LennyHenry @ITV oh damn. Forgot he said he didn't drink!! Still not convinced he's innocent mind! 😜
Finally, a great host of @ITV's #NightlyShow.  @radioleary is killing it tonight with two great guests and making the format work.
@ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV At last a good presenter &amp; amiable one too! Love watching #Dermot....he's a natural! #better
@ITV Full Line Up https://t.co/GiYaZOiO4h https://t.co/MPEi8Hstg2
@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV @alwayslouiss every time...
@WhoPotterVian @ITV I like John Bishop but rest just felt OTT, but tbh I only saw 1 episode of each presenter so not sure my opinion counts😉
Gotta say @radioleary is by far the best presenter yet on @ITV #thenightlyshow! I couldn't watch the other shows! He's a natural! #Dermot
@TheDoctorsGirl @LennyHenry @ITV Think he's been ruled out after vodka clue...
@Ms_tweetz @ITV but you don't take the news off !
Great advert from @visitwales on @ITV. Bring on #yearoflegends #FindYourEpic #wales
@HDYGSR @Kathbum @ITV @itvnews 

So bad, its kinda good :)

Now where is the news?
Another gripping episode of #broadchurch it's sooooooo good! #broadchurch @ITV X
@GabyRoslin @ITV watching now on plus one 😳😳😳😱
@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV I record a few weeks at a time then have a catch up. I'm so impatient but it's so worth it!!
@ITV @radioleary @Rubywax Let me know how goes
Yesssssss it's @Rubywax she's hilarious 😆 #TheNightlyShow @ITV @radioleary
So I saw the "D" on the desk on @ITV The Nightly Show thinking, that's smart all the hosts names have started with a D then I remember John
What an amazing cast in #Broadchurch each episode excels the last one! I can see this being gripping right until the end! @ITV
@ITV @Ms_tweetz IMO With David Walliams - Meh, John Bishop - Not bad, Davina McCall - Bloody amazing, Dermot O Leary - So far, see Davina
@ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV  Respect is jew. x
Anyone else catch that Catherine Tate has a secret @qvcuk addiction? Just shared with @radioleary on @ITV #TheNightlyShow
Swerved #thenightlyshow since week 2, but actually @radioleary doing an excellent job! That's more like it @ITV
Loving @peterdickson 's voiceover on @ITVNightlyShow just like old times @radioleary 😆😉 #TheNightlyShow @ITV
@ITV just admit it. You've made a mistake. The Nightly Show just isn't happening. The 10pm slot is @itvnews - or at least something worthy
Over £2000 raised @UKSepsisTrust in memory of @ChloeChrist2 @ITV @Jason__Watkins @tomray99 @Fern_Britton @GMB https://t.co/vLSi80GF4J
Don't like #thenightlyshow much but at least @ITV is trying something new,&amp; why not. Gotta give it a chance to develop.

Well played @ITV @BroadchurchTV I'm totally lost! #BroadChurch #WhoTheHellDidIt

@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV it's so good
@ITV omg that was awesome #broadchurch
#broadchurch is just pure awesome @ITV can't believe we have to wait another week....
It's not enough @ITV to merely 'say' "if you're affected www.slash" after #Broadchurch #rape storyline! Do THIS. https://t.co/7k1YVB7ynT
Hey #broadchurch now we have 6 days &amp; 23hrs to bloody wait...you cruel bastards.@itv
Enjoying 'Broadchurch' so much more this series. Really strong script and cast thus far. @ITV

@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV Means chuff all. I've a 6th sense. I predicted George Michael would die last year and I got that right!
Every single week I get goosebumps. Excellent acting and writing. I have my theories and they change every episode #broadchurch @ITV

@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV Yeah. Her from Cutting It. She will always be from Cutting It to me you should watch that. It's AMAZING!
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV do you mean kath?
I need a gif with Alec's "who are you?" #Broadchurch please 😍@BroadchurchTV @ITV
@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV Sarah Parish did it cause she knows she cheated with her husband. She was angry.
My first show since winning the @Divasofcolour #BestPresenter #award on the wkend! See you tonight on @Jackpot_247… https://t.co/RQr7T7H9lu
@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV Haha. See this just makes me more certain a woman did it. No other DNA found. A woman wouldn't leave seaman.
#OliviaColman 's face when she's disgusted is brilliant @ITV @BroadchurchTV
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV im on bloody twitter that's why! Too distracting !!!

@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV You only just worked that out love?
@ITV #broadchurch reckon that's cos Trish slept with Jim that morning #spoiler #justguessing
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV oh my god trish had sex with her best mates husband !! Bet that's who she slept with!!
There is an underlying tone within #broadchurch this evening. A group of tech phobes and #socialmedia babies will emerge @itv @BroadchurchTV
@itvjeremykyle @ITV Lovely softie Steve ! 💕
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV good point!
I don't trust anyone in broad church, everyone is a suspect...trying to work out what the red herrings are 🤔 #broadchurch @ITV
Me when adverts come on #broadchurch @ITV https://t.co/qayGSdlhUD
@lottie_smurf @easily_led @ITV yeah deffo!
@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV She had sex with a man earlier that day. She already admitted to that. The DNA is from that encounter.
@Zoe_Ann @ITV Haha. Nope. You're the only other person I've seen thinking the same as me. We are prob wrong but can't shake off the theory.
Last nights #Vera was so good I'd never have guessed who the murderer was! @ITV
Is there more fuckin ad space on @ITV @BroadchurchTV  than drama content?
Ooh! #Broadchurch loving this series #Coleman &amp; #Tennant are outstanding together their chemistry is super #WhoDidIt @ITV
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV think the DNA might be bit of a deal breaker. ...
How many adverts @ITV !!#broadchurch 😭
When @ITV player doesn't let you rewind back to the start of the programme. It's 2017....
@BBCAMERICA When does/will #Broadchurch s3 come to/air on bbca? I know it started on @ITV 2/27 &amp; airs Mon nights 9p. Thanks. @BroadchurchTV

@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV She was drunk. She can't be totally sure it was a penis. Not necessarily a strap on either.
@Zoe_Ann @ITV I've been saying for ages  it's not going to be a man.
That's the same netting used on the assault on Trish @juliehes #Broadchurch @ITV
@MMc1267 @ITV yes!!
@Chloemeadows @OnlyWayIsEssex @ITV just watched Towie well done for standing up for yourself Amber is the worst thing to come out of Essex!!
@Zoe_Ann @ITV That Miller's son now has on his phone
@paulmcc10 @ITV thats one theory 😂 just shows how boring my monday nights are haha!
@MMc1267 @ITV yeah probably way off the mark! But the flash she saw was possibly a phone recording.. Porn going round rhe school? Hmmm
One series too far for Broadchurch, this is absolute garbage of the highest order @itv #sopredictable
@loosewomen @BroadchurchTV @ITV cabby driver too obvious
@paulmcc10 @ITV i kist can't think, so many theories going on in my head! Its obvious the bright light was a phone recording with a flash!

@Zoe_Ann @ITV Oooooh, like your thinking
@Zoe_Ann @ITV yeah, i think it was her husbands new bird
@Zoe_Ann @ITV erm... she said she felt his penis moving in and out.... kind of gives it away? 😂

@KellyAnneOsbor1 @itvjeremykyle @ITV unfortunately they ignore it... and still keep dogs... or 'protectors' of their pussy ass's.. Wimps...
@itvjeremykyle @ITV Your face was a pic JK "Is it going to hurt Roy?"😯When trained appropriately we seem more nervous of the dogs potential
@itvhub @ITV hello, it's on now Tv iplayer app. Been watching it for the last 6 months on there and all good. So not sure what's up :-/
@itvjeremykyle @ITV Some nasty dogs out there...
@p4ulmcr @itv @luckypawsdogs i'll cut thr whatknots off!xx
@itvjeremykyle @ITV It's the vile owners not the dog,or in some cases lack of education and training!
@itv so sad and shocking 😢 UK needs to toughen up on these pure scum no hoper druggies on using dogs #KyleFiles
@itvjeremykyle @ITV I hope those pricks get whats due. The dog is written off from day 1.Hope those twats get the nasty death they deserve 2
@ITV @andy984 What model of TV are you watching on there?
@ITV ohhhhhh I so thought is was gonna say then!!!!!
@ire1972 @JoeSims10 @BBCOne @ITV Deliberate mistake 😂
6 months for cutting a puppies ears off? WTF! #TheKyleFiles @ITV
@itvjeremykyle @ITV if they where men they'd defend themselves. Not train a poor innocent fkin dog to protect their arse. It's fkin cruel...
@itvjeremykyle @ITV #KyleFiles omg it winds me up to see IDIOTS with animals! They should be put on a register to never be able to own a dog
@itvjeremykyle @ITV dog rips up soft toy wow call the cops.
@TVKev @itv Has the audacity to bother us with the weeks lowlights again on a Sunday. I'd rather watch Peston.
Watching #thekylefiles on @itv talking about use of dogs as fighters it's awful, not bad dogs just bad owners #endBSL
@ITV why can't a touch of frost be on ITV3 every weeknight 😔
@packersuzanne @ITV There was talks a few years ago of bringing Brookside back..
@itvjeremykyle @ITV #KyleFiles no such thing as dangerous dogs! Its up to the owners to train them responsibly and include socialising.
@itvjeremykyle @ITV #KyleFiles in my opinion dogs only become a danger if the owners do not give them boundaries as to what they can/cant do

@joshbates94 @ITV cheque * 👀
@ITV @ITVChase @Kate_Martin I would be fuming if I was Darragh! It's team work not letting someone else do all the work. Watching on +1.
@ITV @ITVChase He should have had all the money
Far right extremist neo nazi terrorists forming racist training camps - glad to see @ITV pulling no punches describing National Action group
@MrBrendanCox The dangers of white supremacist and/or Christian terrorism are generally ignored by the MSM. Good that @ITV did this.

@ITV @ITVChase he deserves all of that money. I've never been so annoyed watching someone win #TheChase #givedarraghthemoney 👏👏👏
@ITV @ITVChase You can't have too many Chasers. Feel gutted for him. He should get a portcullis than back door with room to pour molten tar
@metpoliceuk @ITV I'd like to report a robbery on the chase, darraghs just been robbed by 3 cowards #TheChase

Hi @ITV, I'd like to report a theft, it took place earlier on #TheChase, as a bloke got robbed of £9,000 by 3 plebs. Look into it please! x
@ITV @ITVChase https://t.co/2upU48XbRJ
@PointlessAlibi @ITV @ITVChase I agree 100% tonight's show was disgusting. They all got together and robbed him.
Only time I'm fuming that people have won on the chase #freeride #poordarragh @ITV @thechase
@ITV @ITVChase #darragh those 3 should be ashamed #lilylivers
@ITV @ITVChase I don't think I've ever screamed at Twitter and the telly so much in my life! #TheChase
@ITV @ITVChase I think Darragh should be allowed back with some team players next time,
@4pauleiding it was a unique show. It was shown on Saturday mornings on @ITV over here.
@ITV @ITVChase I think Darragh should get his full entitlement of 9k that he gained the team and the others shouldn't have had anything!
@ITV @ITVChase so ridiculous! Bet he wanted to walk of stage!
@ITV @ITVChase Michael  looks like @robbeckettcomic lol
@ITV @ITVChase I always hate it if @paulsinha loses, he's my favourite chaser
@ITV @ITVChase i was darragh i wud killthe lot of them cowards . Why go on the show to bottle it . Once in a lifetime chance . Grrrrrr 😡😡😡😡😡
Darragh you deserve @itv to buy you the best door ever !#gangofchase
@mikeybarlow7 @ChrisMc_89 @ITV that Michael is a right melt
@ITV @ITVChase only #Darragh playing then.
@ChrisMc_89 @JoeCossins @ITV he won £9000, answered 14 questions and only gonna win £1500 🙈😂
@ITV #TheChase is this a joke that poor guy earned his money fair and square and everyone is taking minus' #Darragh #Michael
@ChrisMason_ @BroadchurchTV @ITV I am considerably.
@JoeCossins @mikeybarlow7 @ITV darragh killing it now 😂 they should all give him an extra grand
