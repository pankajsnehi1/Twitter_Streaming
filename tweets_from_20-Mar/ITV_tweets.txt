@Ms_tweetz @ITV Davina McCall is my favourite so far.

@ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV Brilliant start to the week. Dermey best so far, plus fab guests!
Seriously hope @ITV are gunna get another series of @TheHalcyon made. I miss it so much!
@ITV Are there any plans for a 2nd series of Brief Encounters? Thanks
@Downhilldave1 @ITV Totally agree!
The always awesome Olivia Colman in Broadchurch. Cheer up Miller! #oliviacolman @BroadchurchTV @ITV https://t.co/WgD4CKn6X7

@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV Love it! https://t.co/imDA3adJ5o
@capbyrne @ITV Great idea, i find myself in the same boat when watching itv
Probably @ITV should have hired @GregScottTV from @coastcountydab in #Scarborough to present #thenightlyshow instea‚Ä¶ https://t.co/w0s07MS9ju
@itv Surely time to pull the plug on this now, won't be watching this again! #TheNightlyShow #Awful
https://t.co/HgRUvPbPU2  @LBC @DailyMirror @metro @BBCNewsnight @bbc @SkyNews @itv @Channel4News Tom Watson the biggest hypocrite EVER‚ùóÔ∏èüòù
Still a belter of a series, new twists and turns every week!! Enjoy this programme so much. Still one of the best on @ITV #broadchurch
Watch and learn how a talk show should be done @itv. @skyatlantic now. https://t.co/BdK4CqQQQo
@ITVNightlyShow @ITV great show but it's not on long enough! Could have had some great interviews with more time
Watching @Rubywax with @ITV #NightlyShow talking #frazzled Sounds like a plan @Frandommom for @TeamworkTrust #WellbeingHub
@lillybeth1818 @ITV Also zero sense of time or place. Throwing in a few vintage appliances &amp; a bad soundtrack does not a period drama make.
My mind is well and truly boggled.. Broadchurch will be the talking point in the PE office tomorrow! üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #whodidit? #broadchurch @ITV üôà
Fun night ahead with @leahcharlesking. Join us on @ITV from 00:40.
See you tomorrow @radioleary @ITVNightlyShow @ITV üëç
@EmmaAVFC @LennyHenry @ITV oh damn. Forgot he said he didn't drink!! Still not convinced he's innocent mind! üòú
Finally, a great host of @ITV's #NightlyShow.  @radioleary is killing it tonight with two great guests and making the format work.
@ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV At last a good presenter &amp; amiable one too! Love watching #Dermot....he's a natural! #better
@ITV Full Line Up https://t.co/GiYaZOiO4h https://t.co/MPEi8Hstg2
@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV @alwayslouiss every time...
@WhoPotterVian @ITV I like John Bishop but rest just felt OTT, but tbh I only saw 1 episode of each presenter so not sure my opinion countsüòâ
Gotta say @radioleary is by far the best presenter yet on @ITV #thenightlyshow! I couldn't watch the other shows! He's a natural! #Dermot
@TheDoctorsGirl @LennyHenry @ITV Think he's been ruled out after vodka clue...
@Ms_tweetz @ITV but you don't take the news off !
Great advert from @visitwales on @ITV. Bring on #yearoflegends #FindYourEpic #wales
@HDYGSR @Kathbum @ITV @itvnews 

So bad, its kinda good :)

Now where is the news?
Another gripping episode of #broadchurch it's sooooooo good! #broadchurch @ITV X
@GabyRoslin @ITV watching now on plus one üò≥üò≥üò≥üò±
@MikePattinson @BroadchurchTV @ITV I record a few weeks at a time then have a catch up. I'm so impatient but it's so worth it!!
@ITV @radioleary @Rubywax Let me know how goes
Yesssssss it's @Rubywax she's hilarious üòÜ #TheNightlyShow @ITV @radioleary
So I saw the "D" on the desk on @ITV The Nightly Show thinking, that's smart all the hosts names have started with a D then I remember John
What an amazing cast in #Broadchurch each episode excels the last one! I can see this being gripping right until the end! @ITV
@ITV @Ms_tweetz IMO With David Walliams - Meh, John Bishop - Not bad, Davina McCall - Bloody amazing, Dermot O Leary - So far, see Davina
@ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @Rubywax @ITV  Respect is jew. x
Anyone else catch that Catherine Tate has a secret @qvcuk addiction? Just shared with @radioleary on @ITV #TheNightlyShow
Swerved #thenightlyshow since week 2, but actually @radioleary doing an excellent job! That's more like it @ITV
Loving @peterdickson 's voiceover on @ITVNightlyShow just like old times @radioleary üòÜüòâ #TheNightlyShow @ITV
@ITV just admit it. You've made a mistake. The Nightly Show just isn't happening. The 10pm slot is @itvnews - or at least something worthy
Over ¬£2000 raised @UKSepsisTrust in memory of @ChloeChrist2 @ITV @Jason__Watkins @tomray99 @Fern_Britton @GMB https://t.co/vLSi80GF4J
Don't like #thenightlyshow much but at least @ITV is trying something new,&amp; why not. Gotta give it a chance to develop.

@ITV #broadchurch reckon that's cos Trish slept with Jim that morning #spoiler #justguessing
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV oh my god trish had sex with her best mates husband !! Bet that's who she slept with!!
There is an underlying tone within #broadchurch this evening. A group of tech phobes and #socialmedia babies will emerge @itv @BroadchurchTV
@itvjeremykyle @ITV Lovely softie Steve ! üíï
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV good point!
I don't trust anyone in broad church, everyone is a suspect...trying to work out what the red herrings are ü§î #broadchurch @ITV

@lottie_smurf @easily_led @ITV yeah deffo!
@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV She had sex with a man earlier that day. She already admitted to that. The DNA is from that encounter.
@Zoe_Ann @ITV Haha. Nope. You're the only other person I've seen thinking the same as me. We are prob wrong but can't shake off the theory.
Last nights #Vera was so good I'd never have guessed who the murderer was! @ITV
Is there more fuckin ad space on @ITV @BroadchurchTV  than drama content?
Ooh! #Broadchurch loving this series #Coleman &amp; #Tennant are outstanding together their chemistry is super #WhoDidIt @ITV
@easily_led @Zoe_Ann @ITV think the DNA might be bit of a deal breaker. ...

@lottie_smurf @Zoe_Ann @ITV She was drunk. She can't be totally sure it was a penis. Not necessarily a strap on either.
@Zoe_Ann @ITV I've been saying for ages  it's not going to be a man.
That's the same netting used on the assault on Trish @juliehes #Broadchurch @ITV
@MMc1267 @ITV yes!!

@itvjeremykyle @ITV Your face was a pic JK "Is it going to hurt Roy?"üòØWhen trained appropriately we seem more nervous of the dogs potential
@itvhub @ITV hello, it's on now Tv iplayer app. Been watching it for the last 6 months on there and all good. So not sure what's up :-/
@itvjeremykyle @ITV Some nasty dogs out there...
@p4ulmcr @itv @luckypawsdogs i'll cut thr whatknots off!xx
@itvjeremykyle @ITV It's the vile owners not the dog,or in some cases lack of education and training!
@itv so sad and shocking üò¢ UK needs to toughen up on these pure scum no hoper druggies on using dogs #KyleFiles
@itvjeremykyle @ITV I hope those pricks get whats due. The dog is written off from day 1.Hope those twats get the nasty death they deserve 2
@ITV @andy984 What model of TV are you watching on there?
@ITV ohhhhhh I so thought is was gonna say then!!!!!
@ire1972 @JoeSims10 @BBCOne @ITV Deliberate mistake üòÇ
6 months for cutting a puppies ears off? WTF! #TheKyleFiles @ITV
@itvjeremykyle @ITV if they where men they'd defend themselves. Not train a poor innocent fkin dog to protect their arse. It's fkin cruel...
@itvjeremykyle @ITV #KyleFiles omg it winds me up to see IDIOTS with animals! They should be put on a register to never be able to own a dog
@itvjeremykyle @ITV dog rips up soft toy wow call the cops.
@TVKev @itv Has the audacity to bother us with the weeks lowlights again on a Sunday. I'd rather watch Peston.
Watching #thekylefiles on @itv talking about use of dogs as fighters it's awful, not bad dogs just bad owners #endBSL
@ITV why can't a touch of frost be on ITV3 every weeknight üòî
@packersuzanne @ITV There was talks a few years ago of bringing Brookside back..
@itvjeremykyle @ITV #KyleFiles no such thing as dangerous dogs! Its up to the owners to train them responsibly and include socialising.
@itvjeremykyle @ITV #KyleFiles in my opinion dogs only become a danger if the owners do not give them boundaries as to what they can/cant do

@ITV @ITVChase I think Darragh should be allowed back with some team players next time,
@4pauleiding it was a unique show. It was shown on Saturday mornings on @ITV over here.
@ITV @ITVChase I think Darragh should get his full entitlement of 9k that he gained the team and the others shouldn't have had anything!
@ITV @ITVChase so ridiculous! Bet he wanted to walk of stage!
@ITV @ITVChase Michael  looks like @robbeckettcomic lol
