@HeatherRenwick @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK the tuna is labelled "Dolphin friendly" - is it or isnt it
More of this type of collaboration to come in grocery retail...@Morrisons and @JustEatUK announce new partnership - https://t.co/YJH7ytwQSM
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK So they could actually sell dolphin and call it tuna. People lie for $'s and don't care
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK No it's more about labelling rules &amp; regs that don't meet consumer standards.
@HeatherRenwick @Tesco @Asda @Morrisons @LidlUK ar u aware Thailand killing dolphins to protect tuna catch then labelling dolphin friendly?

@Morrisons this was from Shirley, Solihull.
@minimalist000 @Morrisons Glad you love it too!
@Morrisons thanks 4 that. It might be as well to cover up the 10ft sign advertising 24 hour fuel in the meantime. It's extremely misleading

@Morrisons ... Is the removal of standard bags for raw meat etc a new company policy or have you got a rogue store?
@Morrisons Maybe they should look into vacuum packing all there meat then,it's regularly poorly wrapped and the smaller bag's are inadequate
