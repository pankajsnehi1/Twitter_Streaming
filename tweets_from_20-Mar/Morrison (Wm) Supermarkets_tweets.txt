@Tesco @sainsburys @Morrisons @Asda Help me say #cauliflowerplease by selling veg going to waste on British farms https://t.co/fj8XD7oGIa
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK I believe it is but I still don't by it. I have no faith in labels but that's just me
@Roe91 @njfoxwell @Im_Cheaper_ @Morrisons 

The driver would be even later if he phoned ahead for each drop.
There's nothing wrong with @Morrisons "The Shy Pig" wine based drink... 🍷🤔🐽😋 https://t.co/9jxM4lOOhe
@HeatherRenwick @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK the tuna is labelled "Dolphin friendly" - is it or isnt it
More of this type of collaboration to come in grocery retail...@Morrisons and @JustEatUK announce new partnership - https://t.co/YJH7ytwQSM
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK So they could actually sell dolphin and call it tuna. People lie for $'s and don't care
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK No it's more about labelling rules &amp; regs that don't meet consumer standards.
@HeatherRenwick @Tesco @Asda @Morrisons @LidlUK ar u aware Thailand killing dolphins to protect tuna catch then labelling dolphin friendly?
@beefyminge Somebody needs sacking for this! @Morrisons

Thanks Polly @Morrisons, will send in a bit
@Morrisons second week in a row you've been late and not called ahead! 10 minutes late and counting!
@Morrisons hey will the Kilmarnock branch be open tomorrow?
@Morrisons your own brand. My usual store  is Cambourne.
@Morrisons I don't think it's a sackable offence Kirsty. Poor mice though. A mouse is for life, not just for Easter. X

@charbennett_xx @Morrisons What does that mean?
@Morrisons this all suggests to me that there is Major problems @Morrisons or severe short staffing! Went there for 2 things left with Nowt!
@Morrisons Nipped in for a Black coffee to go - £1.49, Chicken skewers 60p, Malt loaf snack pack 60p. Grand total of £5.49. How? 😕
@Morrisons from joe lock manager and all my collegues at morrisons croydon 576 and me kevin trolly dolly we have a hard working team unite
@Morrisons further more there's never any corned beef Pasties? Either Im extremely unlucky every time I go @Morrisons or you stopped selling

@Morrisons ...loyal. We could build a mecca of a store, Derek, if only you'd listen. 2/2
@Morrisons great! Just don't expect to be told to take a 6 mile walk to a competitor for Doughnuts in the pouring rain! Not impressed
@Morrisons calling yourself Taz now, eh Derek? I shouldn't need to research other branches. Tesco sell it, but I'm trying to remain... 1/2

@Bayhar @RetweetToWinUK @Morrisons fab 👌
@Morrisons ... Is the removal of standard bags for raw meat etc a new company policy or have you got a rogue store?
@Morrisons Maybe they should look into vacuum packing all there meat then,it's regularly poorly wrapped and the smaller bag's are inadequate
