@SSE Hey guys I have a query would it be possible to follow us so we can DM you?
@SSE Great. We don't have gas.
@SSE I am an intelligent woman, once again baffled by your over-complicated bill. Plus a price rise, so #shoppingaround #electricty
Hate the grown up task of changing gas/electricity tariff...if only @SSE would answer the phone!

@SSE A week is a long time in energy. SSE wrote to me on 13 march offering tariff deal it now wants to wriggle out of
Interesting to see @SSE have been awarded the @FairTaxMark - but the link to their tax disclosure page is a 404: https://t.co/Tqdl19CAHC ..
