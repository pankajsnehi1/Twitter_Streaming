@paddypower @stef00740
@paddypower why haven't you settled bets from Cheltenham gold cup still says pending , quick enough to take my money , last time I use you😡
@ALOAYE_JAVI @paddypower sometimes you just want to play and play and play, not for anyone but for yourself
@ALOAYE_JAVI @paddypower you don't get it, do you? It's all about the "passion" not respect, or fans or manager
@ALOAYE_JAVI @paddypower or because of his passion for the game, nobody likes being subbed off dude
@Raphinol @paddypower either way they were laughing because he was acting childish.
@ALOAYE_JAVI @paddypower or they are just having fun? Why so serious dude?

@Rhod_morgan @paddypower @Ladbrokes @WilliamHill I've seen ads on illegal sites from most of the big bookies. Bet365 seem to be worst for it
@paddypower No book open on Volta Catalunya? Was hoping you'd have something going.
@HaydenVernon @paddypower @Ladbrokes I see a lot from these 2, @WilliamHill also. they are all merged with other books or owned by another.
@james_clarke_ @paddypower He's just the right balance of grotesquely ugly and a worldy of a footballer that makes him accepted by society
@BenBowers11 @paddypower  so accurate
@Howsonn @paddypower Rib's laugh cracks me up. Grotty cunt
@paddypower Evertons next 2 games against Liverpool and Utd could see their price reduced massively. We're the in form team...
