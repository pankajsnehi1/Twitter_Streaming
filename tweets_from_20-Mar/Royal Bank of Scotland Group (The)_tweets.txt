According to @Channel4News the Treasury was far more hands on with @RBS than they've admitted. Result: small businesses treated very badly
@siobhankennedy4 @Channel4News @RBS Very partisan report.
More disgusting narrative re @RBS corruption, in league with treasury &amp; @Conservatives to crush small businesses.McEwan/Osborne a sleazy duo
Hmm so @RBS were in collusion with the Government to undermine Bywater. I'm glad I'm just keeping a token ¬£10 in my account with these scum!
A state-owned bank, bailed out with tax payers' money, screwing small businesses for short-term profit @RBS @Channel4News #GRG
The @c4news story on @BywatersUK and @RBS with Treasury. Oooft.
