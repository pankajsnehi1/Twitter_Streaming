@KinleyDesmond @YESthatcherDead @SkyUK @SkyNews my thoughts exactly
@WeeScottishMamm @YESthatcherDead @SkyUK @SkyNews Probably because they are not Scottish residents.

What am I paying @SkyUK for !!
Had @SkyUK Sky Q for a couple of weeks, ITV HD (Ch178) keeps breaking up. Other channels seem ok though. Happens on live and recordings...?
Was it really necessary @SkyUK to send me 2x emails within 2 hours asking me to update my details? How often will you contact me if I do!?!?
Saw @ring advert, the woman lied she's about to put her kids in the bath but she's out apparently! That's so wrong - blatant LIE! üëéüèø@SkyUK

@DaveHartley86 @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam i know. They have never once answered me. Changing providers.
@MissRochander @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam will still have to pay full bill aswel, no compensation for having no broadband and having to use 4g
@MissRochander @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam they won't answer, they only answer to people saying how good sky is so it shows up on their timeline
Why do @SkyUK try and fucking rob you all the time trying to make me ¬£50 for someone to come and activate something for me! Doubt it üôÑ
@SkyHelpTeam Bill just came through &amp; can't believe how much my call to @SkyUK cost! ¬£28 to change my tariff, scandalous
