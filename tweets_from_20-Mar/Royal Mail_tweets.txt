Awesome - my @Raspberry_Pi parts showed up from @ThePiHut today...only 11 calendar days from U.K. via @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail I'm sure we're not the only town affected but PLEASE can you ask posties to STOP throwing elastic bands on streets during rounds
@RoyalMail So I got a red card last week, booked a redelivery for Saturday, and it never came.. now what?
@RoyalMail @grazedotcom third time in two months that the postie has taken graze box back to depot rather than leave on top of apt post box
@RoyalMail why is this card being posted today but dated the 18th? And why are we receiving post at this absurd time everyday?
@RoyalMail funny thing is there's a always two or three people at home to answer the door. Why isn't the time on there? #dodgypostman

You put any extra overtime shifts in tomorrow to help deliver all my birthday cards? @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail can an expired student ID be used as ID to pick up mail from a delivery office?
@RoyalMail seems like knowone actually has a clue where it is. Considering it was sent special delivery - ¬£10.45. Seems pretty unacceptable
@RoyalMail checked with post office and they have said it had left, was in transit and may come today (it didn't ...)
@RoyalMail I last phoned Royal Mail to enquire on 15/03 and was told I would hear soon. No mention of anything about a letter on 09/03
@RoyalMail  I have received the head piece. Your choice of shipping and packaging has resulted in the hat arriving crushed and crooked.

@connorcassidy7 You'll need to contact @RoyalMail about this. We're separate companies, they deliver the mail. - Stacey
@RoyalMail there's a certain service and duty of care for our mail that should be standard. now i am not calling theft but it went somewhere
honestly i'm pissed. ¬£30 ain't a lot but to a student it is. and @RoyalMail should be able to deliver a letter without the notes falling out
@RoyalMail I can't really because I just put a stamp on it and put it in the letterbox, so I have no "evidence".
@RoyalMail how do I make a complaint?
@RoyalMail thank you, I know it's not your fault - frustrated with the delivery person!
@Brooshski @RoyalMail hope so. Been asking my dad if I got any post all week. Now the 3 to 5 days are up. Will phone tomorrow if not arrivd
@RoyalMail Nor if it was not delivered. It still says it's on it's way... This doesn't feel like "guaranteed next working day" to me :(
@RoyalMail I sent a Special Delivery on Thursday last week. Tracking says it went out for delivery on Friday. But not if it was delivered
According to @RoyalMail it's incurred a customs charge, but @HMRCgovuk seem to be taking their time sending me anything on it :P
@EmmaControl @RoyalMail i find it deplorable that a service we should be able to depend upon seems to have this kind of ting happen so often
@RoyalMail 2/2 now I have to wait until Wednesday to receive my Amazon Prime order - which was meant to be next day delivery!!

@RoyalMail yes it is
So somewhere along the @RoyalMail postal service, @drunkard103's birthday money got stolen from the card, I am fuming.

@RoyalMail 1/2 ordered something to work delivered via Royal Mail, on your tracking website says it's gone back to depot but no one left me
@hollie_mitchell Oh wow thats extreme, I'm sure you will get them when you phone them @RoyalMail are usually pretty good
@PMoore99 @RoyalMail @australiapost must have gone overland? https://t.co/EKyGaVgGvy
@RoyalMail I thought you meant there was an area on the site to check to see if there was something waiting for you at the local depot
@RoyalMail and wait another couple of days to see if it turns up when they could just shout at the sender and demand a replacement.
@RoyalMail So no attempted delivery date to fill in on the form. I'm not sure how many customers I could convince to do all this, wait
@RoyalMail no but I will as it's happening frequently now. Thanks for the link.
.@RoyalMail Why have next door got my birthday presents!? #NotFair
@RoyalMail Sorry I'm a bit confused. They can go to your website to rearrange a delivery but they have no evidence it had been attempted?

@RoyalMail it came directly from @WelshRugbyUnion luckily they reprinted our tickets after they told us they were dispatched in January

@RoyalMail No, unfortunately I did not get anything
@RoyalMail week. Then we have to pay for them to send the replacement back. It costs a fortune every week and could be so easily stopped
@RoyalMail sent back as uncollected. Or the customer goes to the depot and finds 8 parcels waiting for them they had no idea about like this
@RoyalMail And do I do that on the royal mail website??

@RoyalMail I've been waiting for this particular delivery since Weds last week and was at home to receive it. I've now missed it due to him
@RoyalMail I apologised and explained I missed the door (even though I wasn't at fault) and he was very abrupt and sarcastic.
@RoyalMail my parcel was meant to be here on Friday and said "out for delivery", nothing came ?

@RoyalMail shouted again for him to wait. He literally jumped in the van and put his foot down and sped away. I don't see how he would have

@RoyalMail it is not the financial loss of being emergency taxed it is the fact that anyone could potentially have my details now!
@RoyalMail i did submit a claim but as the forms have no cash value i am not expecting anything. I hoped for an apology and postage refund.
@RoyalMail followed :)
@RoyalMail But it doesn't even say there's been an attempt to deliver it and a card has been left.
@RoyalMail Does not write the full address on the receipt.only city and number
@RoyalMail thanks, I sorted it by removing "ltd" from the address.
@RoyalMail they were investigating it - not sure it's a claim.
@RoyalMail your system is floored! My mail's at recipient but you want to send to Belfast &amp; back to me despite me just giving you location!
@RoyalMail now been informed that it's lost in the system as it's not at the delivery office either. V disappointed, apologies don't cut it
@RoyalMail but redelivery is normally between 9am and 1pm, not practical when working day time
@RoyalMail you should check your system. its says people can't ship books to Brazil when in fact it's possible. You are misleading people

Best to just shop in stores or order only from @amazonprime or @AmazonUK , had enough with @shoptonet and @RoyalMail
.@RoyalMail @DrSaraPayneMBE  sneaky ..sending very nice people to deal with us ..can you do something else so we can talk to them again :0)
@RoyalMail is there a reason why three parcels being sent to me have got lost in the post in the past two weeks ?
@RoyalMail Dear sir, thx for your response.I've not rcvd any letter yet. is there any guarantee that item will be delivered in few days?
@RoyalMail Now it's saying my email is invalid! I want to know where my item is, not to fill out forms!

@RoyalMail How do I talk to a human being to get a parcel redelivered? Your automated system is useless.
Yo @RoyalMail !! Beg you mans lose the letter Theresa May aka Lucifer is sending to the EU to trigger Article 50.
@RoyalMail I've been looking forward to this so i'd appreciate it if I had some help receiving this. Why is my ref no wrong? I can't track!
@RoyalMail thankfully yes! Although, if it had been one day earlier it would've gone with the recycling!
@RoyalMail it went first class signed for on the 10/03, it seems an awfully long time to not be delivered,
@RoyalMail I sent a parcel off 2 weeks on Tuesday for a return and the company I sent it off to haven't received my parcel?
