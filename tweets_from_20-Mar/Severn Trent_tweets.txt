@Samuellificatio @Ameyplc @stwater @coventrycc Hi Samuel, I have not received an update as of yet. I have chased the team again for this
@stwater @DerbyTelegraph seems lots of people felt a lack of communication and commitment by the company at the time of the event 2/2
@stwater @DerbyTelegraph ok - on speaking to neighbours we all think it would have been good for you to have a rep on site 1/2
@AmeySupport @Ameyplc @stwater  @coventrycc Did you get one?
@stwater yeah I didn't think that was the case. I've spoken to the Council; suggest that you inform them too.
@stwater two roads lead to my house. Snelsmoor and High Street. And you've blocked them both. Thanks https://t.co/FxKh9oTOOb
@stwater could you post a picture of the roundabout please; I'm struggling to believe that all routes on and off the roundabout are open!
