@Tesco with a deadpan look on their face. Absolutely no sense of humour or willing to have a laugh
@Tesco I was buying alcohol and said 'do you need to see my Id or do I look old enough?' as a joke and they said 'I'll see it' 1/2
@Tesco when do I get a refund on the items that you couldn't bring as there wasn't a substitute available?
@Tesco Hi i ordered online at the begining of the month &amp; still not been dispatched, could you check the reason pls &amp; DM me 4HHWJT8NB thanks
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK I believe it is but I still don't by it. I have no faith in labels but that's just me
@Tesco thank you for such an efficient delivery tonight #savingmetime
@Tesco Why are your own branded sweeteners getting smaller in size yet more expensive?
@HeatherRenwick @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK the tuna is labelled "Dolphin friendly" - is it or isnt it

@boxofpeppers @WHS_Carpet @Tesco a very accurate review.
@boxofpeppers @WHS_Carpet @Tesco that's a bloody good price, I mean we all need a coaster for our tea!! üòÇüòÇ
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK So they could actually sell dolphin and call it tuna. People lie for $'s and don't care
@JWils60 @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @LidlUK No it's more about labelling rules &amp; regs that don't meet consumer standards.
@Tesco thanks for responding was just surprised is all. Gota admit its late for a food delivery...unless they're into late night snacks
@Tesco when will eastleigh store have Nissin Ramen Seafood Noodles in stock, i cant find a tesco with this in stock anywhere :(
@HeatherRenwick @Tesco @Asda @Morrisons @LidlUK ar u aware Thailand killing dolphins to protect tuna catch then labelling dolphin friendly?
