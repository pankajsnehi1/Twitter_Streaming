@BarclaysUK and I'm still penalized for having to replace my phone.

It's a double whammy of disappointment.
@BarclaysUK take 2 hours out to visit a branch for a 2 minute task?

This is terrible.

I've verified by going to a cash point...
@BarclaysUK I don't have a pin sentry device and the nearest branch is miles away. What am I supposed to do?
@BarclaysUK You've crippled my personal+business accounts by requiring up to 10 days before I can use mobile banking after getting new phone
@jasstabbinsx @Barclays @BarclaysUK maybe ur lucky then!! x
@BlunsdonChloe @Barclays @BarclaysUK yeah same, but doesn't say anything about charges if you go over like anywhere
@jasstabbinsx @Barclays @BarclaysUK eg.i could up mine to ¬£3000 after the first year of uni
@jasstabbinsx @Barclays @BarclaysUK you have to apply to increase your overdraft, i think that just means u can up it after so long
@BlunsdonChloe @Barclays @BarclaysUK the website is so confusing? It's says it'll increase over the terms so like term 1 is ¬£500, 2 is ¬£1k
@jasstabbinsx @Barclays @BarclaysUK its very likely
Unbelievable that @BarclaysUK are gonna be closing down this local branch. It serves a huge community and the alter‚Ä¶ https://t.co/pltR0jY05m
