@rsagroup about time
Maybe I should contact the FSA in regards to my claim with @rsagroup. They've approved the claim in part but now ignoring me.
Shocking customer service from @rsagroup. 28 days since the last connect from claims handler. Feel like I'm being actively ignored.
@rsagroup are you coming back to reference this? #Theft #MoreThan #PetInsurance
