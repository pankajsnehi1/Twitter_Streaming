@sainsburys Not really acceptable to have milk so out of date on your shelves is it? Especially @Cravendale https://t.co/WaLLySP2Yj
@andstill_moving @His_Grace @sainsburys @MeaningfulChoc I'm not religious but for those who are the egg is representing rebirth of Christ.
Perhaps it’s time for Christians to refrain from spending their money in @sainsburys https://t.co/0ewJXGluW9
@cosby_laura @His_Grace @sainsburys @MeaningfulChoc 
And is a chocolate egg *so* meaningful to Easter?
@His_Grace @sainsburys @MeaningfulChoc Wow. I had no idea. What is their problem?
@cosby_laura @His_Grace @sainsburys @MeaningfulChoc   Strictly speaking, aren't all Easter eggs halal?
@Naanster @sainsburys #Naanster This @sainsburys gift card would be fantastic!!!😊

@LeeTheLad @sainsburys Usually only shop there (large shop) when I hve a voucher as the same items are MUCH cheaper elsewhere Thks for tips!
@sainsburys was there any lost property handed into your Curzon Road, Sale store Thursday/Friday last week?
@Amia_Cat @shillorganics @Tesco @sainsburys @asda @gleaningKENT @feedbackorg @ibuybritish how sad and disappointing! #stopthewaste
@LeeTheLad @sainsburys Wow! I've never heard of such an excuse by a retailer-prob same has happened to me then as #sainburys is so expensive
@sainsburys The driver rang but I missed the call. Left a voicemail saying he had been knocking on my door. He had the wrong house.
@sainsburys Are u able to tell me if there is a problem with my order please? Its meant to be delivered in a few hrs but money not taken. Ta
@sainsburys I have spoken to your call centre who told me the driver is now out of my area and can't deliver today.

@sainsburys there's a nasty rumour going about that you are going to close the newly opened Sutton store.

Placed order on Sat 18th for delivery on Tue 21st and for info it's cancelled today
@sainsburys Thanks not sure yet I'll try to think of something :)
