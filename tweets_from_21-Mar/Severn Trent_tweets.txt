@stwater Thanks for the reply, I don't live in the area but drive through it every day was more concerned about the traffic disruption ?
@Lukemallard77 @stwater or do it in a non residential area ?
@stwater Any idea when the issues on Clapgate Lane in Bartley Green, Birmingham will be resolved ? Cheers
@lackerknacker @stwater if it's too noisey mate they could just stop repairing it so you can sleep and keep everyone without water longerüëç
@waterwatchdog how many supply interruptions do we have to tolerate before @stwater invests some money and fixes mains dy12 2xw
@stwater any news on when I can wash me barnet duckie?
@stwater 2/2 no one has been to see me, whilst I understand the issue a note through the door would have helped. There is little on ur www.
@stwater I have a temp traffic light, a mobile welfare unit, restricted access to drive, tankers turning up about every 20 mins and 1/2
@stwater this could have been done elsewhere and not in a residential area and not directly outside houses , coupled with no info v poor
@stwater what is happening apart for some tweets - poor planning and no consideration for those disturbed all night by tankers and pumps
@stwater the issue is at DE23 on the Hollow where tankers have been pumping water for the last 3 nights - no one has bothered to let us know
@stwater no 1 has got back 2 me again 2day -tonight we have brown mud coming out of our taps which has now packed up our boiler #badservice
@stwater Yay, lucky us, looks like another night of pumps and tankers every 20min told there may be a chance it finishes 2nite ?
@stwater I DM my details and I get a link to the ST website saying the prices for unmetered are increasing by 3.9% üò°yet inflation only 2.3%
