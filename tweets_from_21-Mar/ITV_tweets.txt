What I got from Monday night @nightlyshow @ITV

O'Leary: It's not about me,it's about my viewers and guests

The other clowns nearly sank it
O'Leary made @nightlyshow look effortless and natural, not showing off like the other previous clowns. Well done, Dermot @ITV
With O'Leary in charge of @nightlyshow I could easily watch hourly episodes - I wanted more! @ITV Brilliant comedy/talk show
I will DEFINITELY tune into @nightlyshow later to watch the brilliant O'Leary do his stuff. At last a decent presenter @ITV
I say give the @nightlyshow to Dermot O'leary &amp; not the other 3 clowns who messed it all up @ITV  O'Leary is a natural - keep him!
AT LAST! @nightlyshow gets it right. Very entertaining from O'Leary, putting his guests 1st &amp; not himself. Brilliant. He is a winner @ITV
Half way thru Monday's @nightlyshow Dermot O'Leary is miles better then the other useless presenters. Great show, Dermot @ITV I'll watch!!!
