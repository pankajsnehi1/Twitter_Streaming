@jonathan_rubin (I easily renewed and paid for my home and motor insurance via chat.) / @DirectLine_UK
@jonathan_rubin Oh, and they actually offered me a service via chat. It's not just a channel to tell me to phone or email. / @DirectLine_UK
@jonathan_rubin And no problem to switch me from one team (house insurance) to another (motor insurance). / @DirectLine_UK
@jonathan_rubin ... Clear guidance and tools for sharing personal details and making payments. ... / @DirectLine_UK
@jonathan_rubin Great interface. Very clear communications - I reckon they've got good people and good content templates. ... @DirectLine_UK

@DirectLine_UK or just listen to the recording of my conversation with Mandy this pm and Tracey earlier.
@DirectLine_UK Talk to Mandy in Claims and Tracey in Renewals.
@DirectLine_UK So you're 'Fixers'. When will your claims dep't talk to your renewals Dep't or does the computer always say 'No'.
Wow, @DirectLine_UK have mastered the art of service via a chat room. 5 stars. https://t.co/PDVghk9Lk3

@damiendavis @AvivaUK @DirectLine_UK defo. Only thing was they used to price match well, but not this year so off to Lloyd's i went!
@stumeech @AvivaUK @DirectLine_UK It's insurer ping pong. There's no discount for customer loyalty. You need to switch to get best price.
