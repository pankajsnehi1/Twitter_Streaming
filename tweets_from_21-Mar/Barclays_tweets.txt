@BarclaysUK your Chester branch is a joke. Getting rid of all counter staff is so inefficient. Takes 3 x as long to cash a cheque now.
Great to hear from Sue Bomphray and Nick Trowell on how @BarclaysUK is working hard to #employveterans

@BarclaysUK What documents do I need to open a current account? Have recently moved to UK from South Africa. Thanks
Apparently @BarclaysUK does not recognize Italian national ID as valid identification document any more! Simply a joke..
@BarclaysUK @BarclaysUKHelp your app is not working on my Huawei Honor 8. When will you fix the app?
Wow. Just wow. Despite best account health ever @BarclaysUK have written to me saying they're closing my accounts! WTAF?! #banks
@hippyjohnoc @BarclaysUK @Uber what's the story?

@BarclaysUK Will you fix you damn website and stop logging me out every 5 seconds!!! Let me guess, you've outsourced your IT.
I hear ya @WhoIsChantelle but 2/3 cards a year is extreme &amp; if I have a hint of doubt I use my prepaid card   @BarclaysUK

@plumber_angry @BarclaysUK terrible bank for customer service, left them 3 years ago. Should have done it sooner
@monzo &amp; @BarclaysUK  apps let you turn card remote purchases on/off. Guess which one shows an error&amp;forces you to a 10 min call every time?
@BarclaysUK Thank you for introducing the "Pending Transactions" section on your app! So much easier to see where available funds have gone
