Can you help it has been nearly a month now and new employer still has not received refererence requested
@AskLloydsBank and I am STILL waiting for a direct apology for the at best #ignorant, at worst deliberately #insulting "please call us"
@AskLloydsBank @samuelhamuel 
Is there a direct number for me to speak to someone in the referencing out team
@AskLloydsBank or perhaps I should simply ensure any response to something *I* do is issued to my sister - sounds idiotic, doesn't it?
@AskLloydsBank it is ME who should be issued with advice as to what to do if (when) I am unhappy with the response to MY complaint
@AskLloydsBank you clearly don't understand as if you did you would issue a response to the person who made the complaint.
@AskLloydsBank apologies. I looked online and was the first thing I saw
@AskLloydsBank moving to Australia. Want to change my linked phone and address, just making sure that'll be fine
@AskLloydsBank Yeah I did that,  but says account unauthorised. Do I have to wait for a confirmation

@AskLloydsBank NONE of this involves sensitive information - NONE of this makes ANY SENSE. 2/2
@AskLloydsBank So you're telling me the full response to a complaint *I* made will not be sent to me? NONE of this is account specific 1/2
@AskLloydsBank Does anybody body know?
Hey @AskLloydsBank why do I keep getting told I can get a new PIN online only to receive a lovely error? :( https://t.co/jebxfu4Wii

Called to cancel @AskLloydsBank car insurance and told we had to pay £80 because of "extra services".
@AskLloydsBank currently online it won't even let me increase my overdraft by £10
@AskLloydsBank I'm in 2nd year at uni and it's been open for at least 4 years. It's on £50 how much would it be possible to increase it by?
