@damiendavis @AvivaUK @DirectLine_UK defo. Only thing was they used to price match well, but not this year so off to Lloyd's i went!
@stumeech @AvivaUK @DirectLine_UK It's insurer ping pong. There's no discount for customer loyalty. You need to switch to get best price.

@damiendavis @AvivaUK @DirectLine_UK yep and then next year direct line will do it. I was with them for yrs but the price skyrocketed.
Just saved Â£120 by switching my motor insurance renewal from @AvivaUK to @DirectLine_UK. Quick and easy online in under 5 minutes.
@AvivaUK My motor insurance premium is increasing by Â£100 (28%) despite 9 years no claims. Ridiculous! I will be shopping around...
@AvivaUK  @AvivaUKSupport  i've been trying to make a payment all night of a quote &amp; i cant. I really dont wanna have to do it on the phone
