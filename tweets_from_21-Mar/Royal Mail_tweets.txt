@moraisfilipe20 man alive your deliveries are more frequent and impressive than @RoyalMail @UPS and @dhlexpressuk #bwfc
@RoyalMail Whereas when we used untracked (which uses the domestic mail service of the destination country) all was fine.
@RoyalMail Since switching to the more expensive tracked airmail (which uses GLS), we've had nothing but problems.
@RoyalMail Please pass on to upper management that your GLS partners in Europe are absolutely terrible.

@RoyalMail just been informed it arrived today. Only 3 days late I suppose...
@RoyalMail already following
@RoyalMail have the new tax year prices been released yet? If so could you link me to regular, non franking rates for UK &amp; International?Thx
@RoyalMail well might I suggest as a national company with thousands of 'posties' you use policy not discretion to give consistent service!
@RoyalMail what is the point of paying for 24h service if when a delivery is missed I can't collect from depot till tomorrow? Stupid
It's not even like @RoyalMail put anything useful on the others like a CN22. 2 are wasted on a badly placed return address (2/2 rant over)
It annoys me every time I use @RoyalMail online post printer that I wast 3/4 of the labels on an A4 sheet with rubbish. 1/2
@RoyalMail done

It's no wonder @RoyalMail business is in decline when they can't even use common sense to deliver a standard parcel....
@RoyalMail from my current address to something else but on my order confirmation is my current address
@RoyalMail when am I likely to receive my deliver also realised that I had to amend my address which conveniently was wrong

@RoyalMail I think it's send with International Economy. It was shipped on the 19th of February.
@RoyalMail don't really want to report it, just want the parcel tbh! Can I get it from Gartcraig today instead of waiting until tomorrow?
@RoyalMail It's not even on it's way to being delivered - it's still in your processing dept!
Wow @RoyalMail is really cracking down on using the right postage to send packages to the stars #DavidBowie - https://t.co/pQa0dzb8qg
Ohhhh @RoyalMail - you sent the good looking postie to me again üôåüèΩ thank you lord üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ

@RoyalMail hi had a large bubble wrap envelope sent out to me on 16th March via first class. Just curious to why it hasn't arrived yet?
@JordyVSTheWorld @RoyalMail I know and me lol
@RoyalMail Pls advise contact details in India.I have a parcel vide tracking number lv304736995gb.
@JackDavies19_ @RoyalMail shitty America and their earlier release dates.  I just want to play.
@RoyalMail (had already been down drive with letters and had forgotten the small parcel)
@RoyalMail he had left it with another house to save carrying it back!  Was embarrassed when I caught him!  Just remind them of their job!
@JordyVSTheWorld @RoyalMail üòÇüòÇ
@JackDavies19_ @RoyalMail I thought it was out today tbh.  Started to walk to the shops and everything till I looked on twitter
@RoyalMail Is there no way of tracking which depot it's at? Or even a post office?
@JackDavies19_ @RoyalMail fingers crossed.
@RoyalMail can you please help me? I'm having trouble registering on your site with a non-U.K. address https://t.co/a8Sbe8meuy
@JordyVSTheWorld @RoyalMail First Class is 1-3 but 9 times out of 10 it comes the next day but not this time lol
@JackDavies19_ @RoyalMail interesting
@JordyVSTheWorld @RoyalMail It was despatched yesterday lol
Like, @RoyalMail c'mon. Is this really not noticeable? https://t.co/OTwsa7IoJl
@UK_CAA Cause said delivery contains my logbook (kinda priceless as you'll know) as well as my Night Rating application... @RoyalMail
When @RoyalMail manage to deliver an empty envelope cause they fancied letting the contents fall out. THEY HAVE ONE JOB.
Hey @UK_CAA it seems @RoyalMail don't know if they managed to deliver a Special Delivery item to you.. How do I find out if you received it?
@RoyalMail please see previous photo these should have been delivered last Thursday!
@RoyalMail Hello,I can't track the package on your website (to the UK from Australia). Could you update me on the status if I DM tracking #?
@RoyalMail hi, need help with delivery AD037603755GB could you please DM?
Well I wouldn't take too much notice of Vince Cable, he bungled the sale of @RoyalMail, so much for great financial‚Ä¶ https://t.co/k6eTzFWpEW
@RoyalMail Yes I have but got told wait till 24th &amp; it might still be on its way. I send out 3 on that day &amp; 2 has already been received.
@JackDavies19_ @RoyalMail it's not released in the uk till Thursday ?
Pretty sure @RoyalMail purposely haven't delivered mass effect andromeda just to get on my nerves üòÇ
@RoyalMail Hello???
Hoping @RoyalMail haven't redirected my post again. My @grazedotcom box hasn't arrived. :-(
@RoyalMail can I please have some information on RY000102971GB hasn't move from LA since 12/3 customer would like to know where it is?
@RoyalMail So where is it? Has it actually been delivered? Or have you actually lost it?
Today is my 84th birthday... I'll not bark at the @RoyalMail Postie today, seeing as I'm expecting lots of cards.
@RoyalMail Kinda seems like you've failed on "Our guaranteed next working day service with tracking and a signature on delivery" promise
@RoyalMail ... delivered directly to me. Nobody came to my door. At all. And I was home all day
@RoyalMail Surely you guys should know? Isn't that what I'm paying for with Special Delivery? Tracking and Delivery Confirmation...
@RoyalMail it was left at the bottom of the stairs. Signed as "Sarah" but I am the only Sarah in my building. I was home. Should've been...
@RoyalMail Nope, as it's the @UK_CAA it's kinda hard to get a response from them. And it's never a quick process when you do for anything...
@RoyalMail excellent, I didn't know, thanks
@RoyalMail Hi, sent an @ASOS_HeretoHelp  parcel with you on Thursday 16th, but as of today it's still stuck on 'we have your item'?
@RoyalMail it's okay! Postie was just running late todayüòÇ
@RoyalMail will I get an email about it or???
Any chance you can send the person back to my door who didn't bother to chap and just put a card through the door @RoyalMail cheers üò°
@RoyalMail Since when does paying for 1st class take a week to arrive? Useless response @RoyalMail !!
@RoyalMail Yes, we have done so. Surely this is a major breach on data /identity protection. But thanks. Will follow up.
@RoyalMail ive replied.
@RoyalMail Hello, just sent you a dm
@RoyalMail Hi, I just sent you a dm
@thetrainline @RoyalMail did you know your letters sent by regular post get 'lost' when sent to trainline for refunds?
@RoyalMail I'm the receiver, it's an international parcel so I have no clue where the package is now.
@RoyalMail Hi, Please rpely to my Dm. Thanks
@RoyalMail is there any reason why first class mail delivered on 16th STILL hasn't made it to its destination?! üò§
@RoyalMail I think it's about time something is done about the sorting office in our area. Why we are receiving post at that time of night?
@RoyalMail brilliant, thanks
@RoyalMail Thanks. Yes the tracking num is CJ460694597US
@RoyalMail managed to pay a fee twice! Help üôÑ
@RoyalMail 2 passport size pictures of me are gone from it.
@HelenJonesMP @RoyalMail Royal mail is own by the Quatari Royal family isn't it
@RoyalMail @RoyalMailStamps the number I was emailed was an order number. Nothing to track it. I want this sorted WITH my stamps...
@RoyalMail any idea where they are now?
@RoyalMail Yes, Of course. Thank you!
@RoyalMail https://t.co/dYXsQVNHTI
Ridiculous that @RoyalMail deliver to neighbour is an OPT OUT service. I don't trust my neighbours w/nor do I want to burden them w/my mail.

@RoyalMail Ok, thanks
@RoyalMail Your system doesnt recognise the reference number on my Something For You card. Can I still get redelivery?
@RoyalMail also the signature was less than convincing
@RoyalMail your tracker states that my parcel was signed for by me or my neighbour, however none of us have it. What can I do?
@RoyalMail hey Royal Mail thanks for ripping the stamp off my letter... think you have a stamp collector cause it w‚Ä¶ https://t.co/jlbZRepwlG
@dinoprincesschr @RoyalMail or @parcelforce I'd say

@RoyalMail hi if someone sent me a second class letter fri should I have had it by now thanks
Hi there my parcel was return to sender as wrong pobox but has not yet arrived back is there any way to see what happened .@RoyalMail
@RoyalMail hi there, waiting to receive mail but it says it's been in the postal centre since last Wednesday? Is there any way of checking?
Anyone know what UK courier would be used for a parcel from France by La Poste? @RoyalMail @myhermes @YodelOnline ??
@RoyalMail I received the delivery. The online "proof" had my first name on. But it wasn't my signature as they didn't deliver to me
@RoyalMail Sorry, link isnt much help, I still need to know what is the last collection time from the letter box I took picture of?
@RoyalMail I have a parcel "Great Britain (GBLALA) Accept". How long should it take to be released? Tracking RR194791232TH. Thanks.
@RoyalMail I witnessed it coming through my letter box last night at stated time.
@RoyalMail can you help track it down so I can pay fees? All I have is tracking number from US postal service.
What's the purpose of the third check box, @RoyalMail? https://t.co/F9MLjGhIBR
@RoyalMail posted something first class to Jersey from mainland last Wed; tracking says it's still being processed nearly a week later! üò±
@RoyalMail just recieved this in this state. It contains passport photos benefit information national insurance no.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wHTqhJmrSk
@RoyalMail that is not a satisfactory response as I assumed it was being "investigated" since beginning last week
@RoyalMail Waiting for parcel. Tracking says held at post office since 16th March as customs charges due. But have not received notice.
@RoyalMail ??? Even ignoring the fact it should have been special delivery, a standard delivery should be here by now
@TalkTalk Not a great start...you guys get the delivery wrong and we have to pay @RoyalMail to fix it and then collect from the post office!
@RoyalMail it's a little awkward to contact friends or family to ask if they put anything in your Birthday card, don't you think?
@Fosjam @RoyalMail we'd love to help if we can, James! Can you pop us a line using hello@graze.com?
@RoyalMail @ASOS Do you keep items 4 days in truck? Just wondering because never had problem before.
@RoyalMail sent via Armadale post office...no badges etc, just a birthday card sent 7 days before actual event.
@RoyalMail Im already waiting for a month on a package sent with Royal Mail, is there a way at your side to check where it is?
Hi @RoyalMail how long does it take to deliver an item to @ASOS ? It was send on 14th March &amp; still on its way, out for delivery on 18th.
@RoyalMail yup. Like the posties we have around our estate they're decent guys just dislike the errant elastic bands üòâ

@RoyalMail I went to Liverpool on Wed for the Irish passport express service &amp; passport office still not received it. Has it been sent?
@RoyalMail I'd prefer to have my mail in good condition than claim compensation as this is a regular occurrence!
@RoyalMail the card hasn't even been filled in properly so I can't even file a complaint https://t.co/f0d5ntXnQm
@RoyalMail I then get a text saying 'Royal Mail' were unable to deliver my parcel. I go to the door and there is the red card

@RoyalMail waiting for my parcel and the postman didn't even knock the door. I'm sitting in the room next to the front door

@RoyalMail all other courier deliver to the floor correct it's only your postmen who dumb it on a staircase! There was cheque once just left
