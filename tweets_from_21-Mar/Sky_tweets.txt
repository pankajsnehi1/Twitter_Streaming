@finleypoppet @BTCare Good; tell BT you want a new hub otherwise you'll move over to @SkyUK
Another evening of garbage wifi speed from @SkyUK - had to resort ot 4G which is exactly 10x faster.
Well played @SkyUK nearly two hours on the phone, hung up on 3 times and one cancellation as a result. Incompetence personified
@angelanugent27 @SkyUK still no tv signal or response from sky. cancelling. will call you tomorrow mum xox

@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUk Do you really think this is an acceptable service for a customer of 5+ years? https://t.co/rrgFH3PFNy
@barlow_mad @SkyUK do you have skyQ? Cos I get next day updates of the LL show so idk
@SkyUK always pissing off a loyal customer. Sooner I get rid of your broadband, the better!👍🏼 stick your broadband shield up your hole.
@SkyUK your internet is so completely rubbish that I've had to use a hotspot from my phone. Definitely looking at other providers now
Brother-in-law recording 2 things so I have a choice of Pawn Stars or Gold Rush. Why cant you watch a 3rd channel on @SkyUK when recording 🙁

@SkyHelpTeam @skyuk fed up of your terrible service, spoken  to customer service before and to no avail. I think it's time we change to BT.
Thanks @SkyUK for cancelling my internet a week earlier than I told you. No wonder everyone in the highlands is leaving you #internetissues
@SkyUK why is my email continually getting blocked? Over 5 times in less than 6 weeks. #useless #YahooMail

@SkyUK rediculous customer service to actively want you to cancel an account rather than trying to keep guaranteed business #notimpressed
@SkyUK I pay over £600 a year and you tell me it'll take you 6 days to get an engineer out to sort a problem that's not my fault? #sortitout
@SkyUK @TeamSky  shocking service waiting for a call back after making complaint said within 48 hours!!! 5 days later still waiting! Joke!!
@SkyUK however finally get through and the operator was a 9!
Last week I rung @SkyUK about adding broadband to my package, they had no deals for me, today I get a deal, it's too late! Gone elsewhere!
@virginmedia sick of your on demand service not working poor service come back @SkyUK all is forgiven
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam my wife is having issues receiving texts from her bank on Sky mobile anyone able to help?

@jordanread72 @SkyUK @EE @TalkTalk EE have made a bid for you there pal, Sky ain't interested haha
@prmcmanus @SkyUK yeah we still get a virgin offer 👍
Never experienced service like i have tonight @SkyUK are an absolute joke to deal with its been awful better service in @McDonaldsUK
Counting down the hours until @virginmedia gets installed, @SkyUK is slower than Eric Moussambani doing the 100m freestyle
@SkyUK my mums hd box has stopped working, can she get a new one through you for free?
@SkyUK how do I stop domestic and general harassing me with calls every night when I am at work? I cannot answer yet they always call!!!!
@davewilky81 @SkyUK do we still get an offer on Virgin? A new fibre line to the property might help ;-) 
(Tagging SkyUK in all of this, lol)
@prmcmanus @SkyUK and you're only down the road!
We aren't in a contract anymore so looks like we are going to leave. No reason to stay.
@davewilky81 @SkyUK (over WiFi, while my kids are streaming to the Chromecast)
@SkyUK fix your FUCKING broadband
@davewilky81 @SkyUK I'm with TalkTalk, and my upload is better than your download. Sky need to pull their finger out https://t.co/HDWuEMedwf
If @SkyUK truly 'Believe in better', then why after 6+ years, is it still not possible to watch @BBCOne HD on channel 101? Not even Sky Q! 🤔
Nope nothing, maybe they are having connection issues? #ironic @prmcmanus  @SkyUK
Actually cannot wait to get away from @SkyUK
I am a new customer &amp; sky Q has stopped working with no sound. Called sky and it's a week for engineer to come out. Absolute joke 😡 @SkyUK
@SkyUK Why do all the DC superhero shows keep skipping weeks? No Arrow past week, no Supergirl this week. Why? It's really irritating
Immmm readdyyyyy @SkyUK pattern this I beg. What channel ????????? https://t.co/Wp01XKgpIQ
@SkyUK so good when you speak to someone that understands they're in a "customer service" role! Shame not all your employees are like Craig!
@virginmedia can i cancel my contact because you have increased your prices. I want to go back to @SkyUK. I never had this with them. #gosky
@SkyUK @F1 how do i watch in uhd, i have sky q box and uhd tv, but listings for f1 only say hd
@weffanie @SkyUK unbelievable! I will cancel!😠
@weffanie @SkyUK cheeky rats! do I have to cancel it? can you get any tv? xx
@davewilky81 @SkyUK no reply yet?
@davidlaing93 @SkyUK @FOXTV Exactly mate
@SkyUK you told me it would be simple, can't connect tv in bedroom!!... #sressedtothemax
Moving to #Scotland and @bt_uk can't provide fibre but want to increase my bill by £6pcm. Good job @SkyUK is half the price of the BT bill
@BigmoNolan @SkyUK @FOXTV exactly. If I wanted to watch people talk about it, I'd talk about with other people
@davidlaing93 @SkyUK @FOXTV It's a pain in the arse, I want to watch the walking dead not watch people talking about it
@SkyUK please put the first 8 eps of Modern Family season 8 on Sky Store please 💙
@BigmoNolan @SkyUK @FOXTV mine records alright, I just don't like the fact that talking dead records too and not having a choice about it
problems @SkyUK with internet
@SkyUK we've not had any phone line or Internet for over a week now. Fault is external. What's taking so long?! Ridiculous.
@davidlaing93 @SkyUK @FOXTV That happens to us too, it drives us crazy, it didn't record last night either
@BigmoNolan @SkyUK @FOXTV it does mate. If you delete the recording of it walking dead goes too
@davidlaing93 @SkyUK @FOXTV Does yours record that as well even though you only put The Walking Dead on for record
@SkyUK what time are your call centres open till tonight!? I'm thinking of an upgrade 👌🏽
Goodbye @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam, hello @virginmedia! Hopefully you treat us better than Sky ever did. 10x the BB speed at half the price.
@SkyUK please fix your wifi
@SkyUK why is it faster to use my 4G than to use my home broadband lately? It's been getting slower and slower.
@SkyUK @F1 . Always been with sky. But competitors have better deals. £18 a month just for F1 I don't watch football etc. It's time to move.
Dunno whether I'm tryna watch a video @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam or whether I'm just watching pictures that chance every 5 seconds?
@thecircus__ @SkyUK where abouts have you found it on sky?? I can't find it
@barlow_mad @SkyUK what do you mean?
@SkyUK price increases YET AGAIN but cant even stream U tube on a I pad. Time for a change. TV internet and phone all going. Useless
@SkyUK why can i not download new programs to my ipad from sky q app when ive been able to download for past few weeks?keeps saying need box
@SkyUK @FOXTV why do I have to record talking dead when I'm not interested in it?
@SkyUK Telephonist just told me I could ONLY have the latest Sky Q offer if I promised to say 9 or 10 at end of call survey regarding him.
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK what does it take to get a response and some action. Even just a response? I am paying for a service. Don't ignore me!
You can of course get @skyuk to install SkyQ for £99 if you take out a multi screen at an extra £12 a month. £12x18mths = £216
Just wow!
@SkyUK Disgusted that you want to charge £65 for an engineer to come out when I pay enough as it is. When it's an error of yours not mine
So if a new @SkyUK customer wants SkyQ it’s £15 installation. If you’ve been with them for say 10 years they want £199! WTF?!
Which broadband next @SkyUK @EE because @TalkTalk are shite.
.@SkyUK I've called 3 times. I've had 2 advisors tell me they'll call back. Still no call back. What is going on? #poor #customerexperience
@SkyUK Our telephone and Broadband line is down. Teenager on meltdown. Help me!
Top service from @SkyUK engineers today. Big thank you for fixing our sky box!
.@SkyUK please please return my call!!!! I'm a customer of over 10 years who is giving you £1000 a year. Do I not deserve a return call?
@thecircus__ @SkyUK where are you finding that??
@donnaair @SkyUK @9pm no it's a brilliant watch.
Top class service from @SkyUK. Miles better than the other lot.
my parents made the BIGGEST mistake EVER going with @SkyUK for a broadband choice as their connections in bad weather are CRAP
@SkyUK https://t.co/620WZKvyXa
@SkyUK hi, I'm trying to download the late late show with James Corden from last night. Has it been removed or is it my wifi connection?
@SkyUK @F1 wish it was affordable to working class households, outpriced to have the good toys on sky
@virginmedia your on demand service is so bad. Always get the 319 error. Not a patch on @SkyUK when it comes to interface and on demand
Is it wrong I'm already excited for billions on @SkyUK @9pm
I buy a new router and my internet goes fine.. 2 months later, its back to the old days.. absolutely pathetic. Sort it out @SkyUK
Paying 115 a month to @SkyUK and got  phone line cut for no reason.  No wifi now for a week.  Thieves.  You deserve jail
@SkyUK absolute load of shit
You have to love being lied to by BT engineer @SkyUK and @BTCare - I must be a soooo scary that he has to blatantly lie to me 😱

@SkyUK @F1 Sky Q Ultra HD is such a RIP OFF!!!!

Min subscription £80+ a month???????
@SkyUK hi how do I go about stopping sky sending me LFC Tv deal emails. As a MUFC supporter the very thought makes me feel very very sick.
@SkyUK @F1 Key words "Up To 4X" so what is the lowest? Standard HD?
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam Why do you make it so hard to cancel subscriptions, been on the phone to you it's for 25 mins &amp; got no where 😫😫😫
@SkyUK is there a reason why the catch isn't on sky go yet?

@SkyUK And then to be told "If I do it you will have to call back to re-pair the box" is a direct implication they intended to do it wrong!
@SkyUK @johnlewisretail Apparently it is! confirmed by @LGUK https://t.co/ci2xPILmxG
@SkyUK It's not a difficult request I should not have to provide the viewing card of the 2nd box as it's the 2nd card on the account.

Imagine trying to watch a film and all it does is buffer every 2 seconds if that. @SkyUK broadband is diabolical
@ThatFruityGuy @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam Hope you got it fixed, pretty poor "hack" to be honest, hassle for non-techy people who will be confused.
@ThatFruityGuy @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam Remote management then allowed the "hackers" to openly login to your router default login "admin" "sky"
@ThatFruityGuy @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam Hold the reset button on your router; it happened because you must have enabled remote management.
@SkyUK CUNTS
@garemsjames @SkyUK @SkySports was a great game with good goals
