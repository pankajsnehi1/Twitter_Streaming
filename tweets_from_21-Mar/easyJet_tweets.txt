@easyJet sorted? Nothing was done about it! I feel more for the kids that were sitting around anyway. Not looking forward to my next flight
@easyJet se de sobra que las maletas las tiran literalmente por que lo he visto pero lo que no hay derecho es a que te la rompan

@Jen_Hol @jonbru @BBCPM @easyJet @Ryanair Yes, to Turkey and Tunisia, although not many people are travelling to the latter.
@Stewcarr @LDNLutonAirport @easyJet @standardnews 10/11 February only just able to process how bad it was.
@easyJet can i get a response from someone this is ridiculous !!!!!!!
Think it's disgusting that @easyJet charge £150 admin fee to change a booking 😤😤😤😤
@easyJet Vuelos posteriores recogieron antes su maletas. Las esperas tb son trastornos en las vidas d las personas. Sobre todo si hay niños
@MT_Aviation @iLove_Aviation @easyJet @Aviation4_Life @Aviation_Pic good work Team
@jonbru @BBCPM @easyJet @Ryanair Do they even fly those routes?  #bbcpm
@easyJet 3 hours late and had to buy coach tickets as no trains running. Last time flying with easyJet.
And the in-law's @easyJet flight from the same airport is also delayed (no plane) so looks like we'll all have an extra night in Greece.
@BBCPM How much are @easyJet and @Ryanair and their ilk going to rake in the cash following #electronicsban from certain countries?

Hey @easyJet if you could have a single flight on time for my next holiday. https://t.co/bKMlGv2WpU
@easyJet In light of electronics ban on in-bound Turkey flights. What happens if you only have hand luggage to carry on-board? #concerned

So annoyed right now! Was looking forward to my @easyJet  flight in a few weeks only to be told im not getting a window seat  both ways 😣😣😣
@easyJet but for further help, I'll have to kindly ask you for your correct booking reference. Please send this so we can check again
@easyJet so what's the deal? I'm going to keep tweeting so probably best to just pretend like you have some customer service.
@easyJet Thank you for your message. 
I'm sorry to hear you are still waiting to hear from us. 
I can assure this case is being handled,
@easyJet ok thanks

@RyanMorrisonjsy @easyJet always worth keeping your passport available, just in case you have to divert to Dinard, then you can get off
@easyJet thank you Ruben. That's great 👌🏻😁
@BSRJersey @easyJet I usually travel myself on press card but do have passport just in case
@BSRJersey @easyJet thanks - I ask because last time spent ages convincing Luton check in I flew to England without child ID
@easyJet EZY4207 8/17 cancelled fly to Pisa. I got to Rome 9/17 and you don't want to pay transport train expences Rome-Pisa as claim form
@easyJet @RyanMorrisonjsy Don't need a passport, but what other photo ID is airline accepted? I'll ask when I'm back at the airport later.
@easyJet I have now been waiting a month to get my expenses refunded. you really sucks 100 %

@easyJet ya he enviado varios, y también a través de la web, la denuncia está hecha a la Agencia Estatal de Seguridad, no hay derecho
@easyJet @RichardAyoade the best short break I hav ever had going back again for the Xmas markets
@easyJet appalled by the lack of service my mum got flying with easy jet yesterday with a broken femur.  Never to be trusted and used!!!
@easyJet flight 3470 pmi-&gt;ham on the tarmac for two hrs and the crew is refusing to give anything to eat to small children... worst service
@easyJet @RichardAyoade Hungary, beautiful, inexpensive &amp; with a secure border. It's our next holiday, we've booked.

@easyJet Refusing to reimburse expenses after 2 day flight delay and being told to book own hotel - totally unacceptable #brandfailure

@easyJet hey guys! Experiencing problems with your support by email, could you help?
@easyJet 4 days and no bags. Told they are with a courier and may arrive today. Upset many people have had my bags, hope they are safe?
@easyJet morning, is your website working? Tried to book flight but didn't go thru. Thanks 🙂
@transaviaFR je suis arrivé, merci. 4 heures de retard a Vérone.  Malgré cela, service clients parfait,  bien au dessus de @easyJet
@easyJet you've sent an utterly pointless canned response that does not help in the slightest - I am livid.
The moment you're desperately  searching your email account for those @taportugal plane tickets and you realize you actually booked @easyJet
@easyJet  can you change your document that has been used to buy tickets?
@easyJet thank you to your wonderful staff - all sorted, incredibly helpful. Easyjet? Nah...Khalessi Jet ;)
Best thing about being on hold @EasyJet complaints? Relentless and distorted first minute of Human on repeat . #Human #killers
Things worth getting on a plane for... @TheCrystalMaze at Old Granada Studios! Via @easyJet mag ✈️ https://t.co/ACHBuQ5xSN
@easyJet wondering when someone can reply to my DM or my facebook message. Thanks

@easyJet come on, two people in Valencia, one has a seat, the other is on standby. Give me options. We BOTH need to be in LGW today.
@easyJet will increase @manairport to @kefairport from 7 to 9 weekly this winter. Giving Icelandair a run for their money it seems!
@easyJet Hello -- I need to add hold luggage to a booking that wasn't made through easy jet. Can you help me do this please?

Vile company!

Stop overbooking flights maybe?
@easyJet can two travellers over 18 have boarding passes on the same phone? Or do each have to have a phone?

@KLM_UK nonsense.  Is that then to say that other airlines are less H&amp;S conscious than you are?  @Ryanair @British_Airways @easyJet
.@saraelle666 Unfortunately @Easyjet will blame it on 3rd party contractors...which they've contracted! #Shambles
@BBCNews when will you investigate @easyJet for breaking EU regulations &amp; refusing to pay compensation for flights delayed by a birdstrike?
@Grant_Denholm Hi Grant , appreciate your frustration. I'll follow up with @easyJet and their ground handling staff on this. Thanks JE
@EDI_Airport @easyJet  made to stand outside for 20 minutes before being let on EZY232. Freezing cold. No explanation. Amateurs.
