@i_am_carvallo @Betfred @paddypower @BetVictor @SkyBet I had him in an four fold so what you reckon with my bet ?
@PPOffers @paddypower Not refunding bets on Jason Day accumulators. Terrible shame if you ask me. #Bet365Are #MovingForward
@AaronRobertson9 @Betfred @paddypower @BetVictor @SkyBet I had him with a winning parlay, so I'm sure they will not because of this.
@i_am_carvallo @Betfred @paddypower @BetVictor @SkyBet really bad if they don't
@simon_orourke @paddypower Then it should be "What's that all about, que?"
@AaronRobertson9 @Betfred some are saying yes some no, @paddypower @betvictor TabAU etc all refunded @skybet too
@PPOffers @paddypower What about legs on accumulators? Are they being made void?
