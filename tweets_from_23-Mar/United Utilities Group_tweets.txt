Please be careful at the junction of Hathersage Cres / Melandra Castle Road - water leak @unitedutilities aware https://t.co/4xKupUqBmt
@unitedutilities have bottled water. Prefer @unitedutilities to get on and fix the problem. +6 hours response time #poorservice
@unitedutilities patience very thin now. Children, families with no water for nearly 7 hours. Need action, not words
@unitedutilities I certainly will Adrian - once again thanks for all your help
@unitedutilities They did a great job and a credit to you - plus means Crewe's canine leak detector wasn't runningâ€¦ https://t.co/6faiJBEjxD

No water, poor pressure, #poorservice
@unitedutilities cheers, just the water would be excellent- thanks
@unitedutilities any idea when the water supply will be back on in CH43 Prenton
@unitedutilities thanks for the response Adam was worried it might not get sorted today.
@unitedutilities any updates? Any idea when the water will be back?
@unitedutilities why has it taken so long to get onsite in #ch48?? The updates suggested you were en route mid afternoon- now it's 6pm??
@unitedutilities thank you - will wait for updates
@unitedutilities any news on when the water will be back on?
