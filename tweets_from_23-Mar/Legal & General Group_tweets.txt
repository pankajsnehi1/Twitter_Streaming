@ClarityFPpurley @landg_uk speak to someone, don't be silly! What do you think this is? A service based industry!

@landg_uk DM if you wish, please.
@landg_uk @fryer_nathan It's not about chasing, I want to speak to someone about this particular case. How?
@landg_uk The issue appears to be with your Water Escape line. When I followed the wrong path on your phone tree, I finally got through.
@landg_uk It's been an hour and a half since I was transferred now. I have to do things. Very unimpressed. Hanging up.
@landg_uk Do you guys answer your phone? Sent by Payment Shield On hold for over an hour now. Don't believe 'on your way to help' anymore
