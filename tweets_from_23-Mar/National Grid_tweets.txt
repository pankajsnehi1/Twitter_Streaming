A good day with @nationalgriduk today, some fantastic work going on there.
@nationalgriduk Leaving a 'sorry we missed you' card after you messed up my gas supply without warning is unacceptable.  Yr usual practice?
@nationalgriduk Have been asking when you plan to reconnect my gas  since 1800 hours today. No help from your helpline. Pls advise.
