internet and tv with no phone line?? whos got the better deal? @VirginMediaIE  @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam
Great use case for Sky Voice search last night. See ad for tv show, press voice button, say name of show, press record, done #skyq @SkyUK
@SkyUK @virginmedia @bt_uk  First company to cable my street with fibre gets me as a customer for life. 1.5mbps just doesn't cut it.
@andystock22 @SkyUK @bt_uk I've always spoken to people based in the UK; usually Scotland, guessing by their accent. #Lucky? üêº
No better way to start the day than have a @SkyUK customer care person not listen to you, talk over you and basically be really rude
@SkyUK Start by answering the vast majority of calls in UK &amp; Ireland like @bt_uk. Here is an email I received  from‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QqfbkR30CE

Thank you @SkyUK for voice control on my sky remote. Putting a programme on in the middle of a child breakdown is now easy !!
@SkyUK When are you going to sort out the all formats thing when you select it you show HD and SD never UHD even when it is in UHD WHY
@SkyUK His English was so poor.  @bt_uk will be handling 90% of customer calls in the UK &amp; Ireland.
Dreadful customer service from @SkyUK call centre in India last night.
@WalidPhares Ha ha ha. More ignorant speculation from a fuckwit on @FoxNews . @Ofcom don't let Fox buy @SkyUK
@celticman223 @GraceBrodie @SkyNewsBreak @SkyNews @SkyUK @IsThisAB0t I cancelled my Sky in 2014.

@SkyUK My Sky Q remote no longer works. My Sky Q box constantly freezes or just refuses to do anything. What am I paying for exactly!? üò§
@edwardcasbon @SkyUK Could be over heating, or just on its way out. Certainly Shouldn't be a regular thing.
@SkyUK why can't I watch S4 of Real housewives of Cheshire on demand having just watched S1-3?
@skyuk short term price hike = lost customer when we move #shorttermthinking

@Veritym_ @wagecuck @SkyUK Because non of us could name a time when an East Asian committed a terrorist attack in the west. It's funny
@SkyUK understand why after finding on, On Demand. Art to be relatable &amp; on point has to reflect the times. Which sadly are not always good
