@DirectLine_UK Ok, Continue to follow the white rabbit I guess.....
@DirectLine_UK thank you Chloe.
Thank you to @DirectLine_UK for making my claim simple. I've never been in an accident before so didn't know what to do. Guided through well
@DirectLine_UK Well @NatWest_Help say its with you, this is indicative of the service we have recieve. DL underwrite, its your "engineer"!
Sorry @DirectLine_UK but every time your adverts ask if my insurance does things i know @_withjack always does
@DirectLine_UK i know, it's just the wording, like don't not press on this button if you do want to not get no emails... And u did it twice.
@sb7jon @DirectLine_UK account related issues, as we can try to help with that. 2/2 Thanks IK
@sb7jon @DirectLine_UK You're very welcome Jon, we hope the issue is sorted for you soon. Please let us know if we can help with any 1/2 IK
@NatWest_Help @DirectLine_UK  so, Direct Line, what say you? Thank you NatWest!.....
@sb7jon @DirectLine_UK It would be best for them to look into it as it is a separate complaint process with them Jon. 2/2 Thanks IK
@sb7jon @DirectLine_UK I'm sorry for the service you have received Jon. Unfortunately this complaint is held with @DirectLine_UK 1/2
@NatWest_Help @DirectLine_UK 2/2 a complaints proceedure which has got us nowhere. Claim ref: 043069962/1
@NatWest_Help @DirectLine_UK we have a joint acc, my partners acc, this policy &amp; my father-in-law has a business acc. We've started 1/2
@sb7jon @DirectLine_UK We're sorry to hear this, do you hold the Insurance separately or part of an account? IK
@NatWest_Help @DirectLine_UK Our brand new (300miles) car was written off by a dangerous driver. Your engineer will not settle reasonably.
@sb7jon @DirectLine_UK Hi Jon, sorry to hear this, is there anything we can do to help? IK
@NatWest_Help @DirectLine_UK No wonder Natwest are leaving the car insurance market. The service can only be described as an ordeal!!
