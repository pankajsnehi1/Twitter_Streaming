@easyJet we have flights booked through 3rd party with you but accidentally put me as Mr not Mrs. Will passport doc change this?
@easyJet Hi, along with having carry on luggage am I also allowed to carry a rucksack?
@easyJet email says 1hold bags (Total combined weight 40kg) -I'm confused; isn't the limit 20kg per bag? So therefore do I have 2hold bags?
@easyJet are you stopping Edinburgh to Funchal then as its only on sale until October and everything else is on sale until next year?

@easyJet Hi. I'm flying out to Holland Friday week on an EasyJet flight from Gatwick. Will I be able take my iPad on board with me?
absolutely furious with @easyJet - if you can't hold enough cabin bags, don't let people book hand luggage only seats!

@easyJet Hi is it possible to get a full payment confirmation of my previous booking ERH2PC6. Unable to get it directly via email.
@easyJet but there is no way the other staff members should have let this happen, especially if it's not the first time.
@easyJet I realise I should have said something to the employee in question, who stormed off after the incident and the remark.
and for all other @easyJet employees to simply do nothing - not stepping in once to defend the customer from the barrage of abuse.
@easyJet Staff should never be allowed to bully, intimidate customers and then 'justify' this with racist comments
@easyJet easyJet should take necessary measures to ensure something like this never happens again.

@easyJet Suggesting this wasn‚Äôt the first time this employee had done something like this.
@easyJet When I told her that she shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to say things like that she replied with a resigned shrug.
@easyJet Loud enough so many people near the front of the queue could hear, including the person checking tickets.
@easyJet When she finally allowed the passenger to board the plane she proceeded to pronounce a racist comment about the passenger
@easyJet Explaining in a very loud, infantilising &amp; humiliating way what she thought the problem was (seemingly something w his suitcase)
@easyJet I arrived late in the altercation but @easyjet staff member was being extremely patronising to passenger
@easyJet Shocked that no other @easyjet employee stepped in to either defend the passenger or call out the employee
Witnessed a horrifying racist incident last night at Venice airport by an @easyJet staff member against a fellow passenger
@easyJet HELP! Need to change flight for me, but not for wife and son. Child is on my booking, though... Can you help? R
