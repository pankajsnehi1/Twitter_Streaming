@blakeharrison23 @ITV love love love PS73 !! 😊
@ITV have knicked @homeland style theme music #shameonyou
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV Sorry Julie, felt your line of questioning with Home Sec unfair. No evidence of failing of security services
I also think that @ITV should have made more shows with Holly &amp; Fearne together 💁🏼 Like a female Ant &amp; Dec situation 🤓
Join @craigstevens and @CarriePresenter tonight from 00:15 on @ITV.

Said from the start, @radioleary should be the permanent host of @ITVNightlyShow! Been good this week! @ITV
Jeez @ITV  sort your newsreader out. He is awful.
@ScarlettMoffatt marry me now. Well she's on #Celebjuicelive @celebjuice yayyy!! My night is sorted. @itv

@ITV producer: "I know, we'll make #thenightlyshow more interesting by getting James Blunt on... Erm... no 😂 https://t.co/O05MctCVXC
Why can't @ITV bring back "Britannia High" ?! #nostalgia @mitchhewer1 @arlenephillips It's what we need!! #unitedasone 🇬🇧
@ITV #theknightlyshow ain't #jamesblunt a total name dropper Shutup mate.
If @ITV did a late night chat show it would be the worst late night chat show in the world. #thenightlyshow

@ITV I'm really embarrassed by #theknightlyshow tonight. Dermot sketch #cringe Don't let #jamesblunt sing new song #evenmoreembarrassing😳😖😳

@ITV @radioleary @antanddec @JamesBlunt oh so poor 
what's wrong with just a chat show
@viveksharma98 @radioleary @antanddec @ITV Dermot is the only host who's manages to pull it off.
Not sure on what grounds Sarah ('Miss Flowers') was being held in custody though on @ITV #PrimeSuspect1973

See you tomorrow @emmerdale @ITV 👍
@sizjam68 @BBCNews @ITV @sky He was a man of vision and what we have now is the result of being politically correct !
@RadioTimes Fed up with @ITV. They cancel good dramas like Home Fires and The Halcyon. I feel it's not worth investing my time in new drama.
How come the @ITV player app isn't available on the #PS3 When you can get the #BBCiplayer #All4 and #Demand5 apps on there?? Bad craic.
10 mins until Philip's appearance on @alienfuncapsule @ITV
@Graham_British @BBCNews @ITV @sky 
Hence the Enoch Powell stuff all over your timeline? 🤔
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV So basically we really are unprotected &amp; just wait for the nx radical Islam Devil to slaughter more Brits ,🐷🐷
@loukenders @itvnews @ITV What happened I missed it ?
@ITV when can we have the @itvnews back on at 10 o'clock instead of that rubbish #thenightlyshow 😡
@ITV Why are the Ladies Of London episodes not working on itv hub catch-up???
@loukenders @itvnews @ITV The "Religion of Peace" strikes again.
@ITV Well done for terrorising the nation, spreading fear of terror, lets remember those who have suffered and pull together.
Why is there not uproar over the disgusting racism on @itvnews? Why???? #london #Westminster  #WestminsterAttack #londonattack @ITV
@XPixie27X @ITV yeah I thought that too. Guy was trying to be pc.
@piersmorgan  @itv programme just called the terrorist a gentleman #confused is he not a killer
@wholelottaloew @ITV @itvfootball Thank you for writing this, I totally agree!
@utv 😪 Network announcer tonight. @MWTweets @ITV Really have really taken over now.
#emmerdale Really has gone down hill lately. Storylines are so predictable 👎@itv
@ITV cheap shots and poor questions. Shame on you when London is trying to UNITE your trying to attack for ratings ....
@JackSavoretti @ThisisDavina @cubanbrothers @KimberlyKWyatt @ITV you were really amazing on the show be proud of yourself xxxdavid
Hoping that in the last 30 minutes Emma has packed her bag &amp; Fecked right off...! @emmerdale @ITV #emmerdale
Very dissapointed with the Terror in London program tonight It seems like all @ITV care about is numbers and not the heroes of yesterday?
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV Etchingham is another politically correct establishment lefty, people are waking up by the day to their bias.
@itvnews @ITV Scandalous 'journalism'.
Why has @julieetchitv just denied the evidence on #prevent from Lord Carlisle? Dismissed out of hand. This interview is a disgrace @itv
Even seeing @ITV and @itvnews in the tv listings makes me feel cheap and as if I need a shower.
@antanddec @ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @ITV Will you also watch it? 😜
Or do you watch your shows to see how it looked on the telly?
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV 3 innocent people slaughtered outside UK parliament and your debating Islamaphobia ? Terrible
@ITV @CelebJuice @lemontwittor so NOT HAPPY with my 🚗 was about to leave an hour a go to get in line, and it wouldn't start 😭😭😭😭
@ITV programme about #londonattack 95% about how muslims are going to be affected 👏👏👏👌👌👌 thats why this countries fucked.
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV fucking disgrace. worry more about how Muslims feel. Islamophobia angers people more than terrorism  😡
Please don't call a terrorist a gentleman. @ITV #TerrorinLondon #Tonightspecial
@ITV Why did they not deport these muslims that are under the eye of the police and this would knot happen the gov make me sick
@Markhayward69 @ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV same here,  Julie's and the Tonight programmes approach to this is totally wrong.
@ITV @GMB Can I ask.... how much longer are we going to have to suffer Piers Morgan in the Morning?
Watching @ITV and so far they have said the attack was a "good attack'" and called the attacker a "gentleman" ... SERIOUSLY?!?!?
All the freaks and nutters come out with their theories after a tragedy? Terror in London @ITV  alleged experts and it still happens, why?
The presenter on #itv #terrorinlondon programme is extremely annoying ✋🏻 @ITV
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV Disgusting way to interview stopped watching
Whoever is interviewing @AmberRudd_MP needs educating, she's awful @ITV #itv
@NWalesPoliceFed @AmberRudd_MP @ITV there were no failures, nigh on impossible to plan for these lo-fi attacks. Police need space to mourn.
@skyblueaub27 @ITV shite mate. How anyone can foresee some one ploughing a car into people is beyond me. ITV can get fucked
.@AmberRudd_MP on @itv justifying #Police cuts. Then Julie fuckface "Mosques need more protection"; they are all cunts #WestminsterAttack
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV awful turned it off. Far too early to cast blame or expect answers.
@CoraAandD @antanddec @ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @ITV i hope it works tho. Can't promise anything. Fingers crossed I would say
@Eley01 @emmerdale @ITV what time is @emmerdale  on again Shaun
@ITV this is an embarrassing interview on the Home Secretary .
Blimey @AmberRudd_MP really slapping down the stupid cow interviewing her on @ITV
@BothofIlse @antanddec @ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @ITV oh my god! That would be too nice!!
Go on Julie Etchingham @ITV
Always good to see @ITV tonight programme looking to blame security and intelligence service for the attack yesterday! Cheap journalism😡
@ITVTonight @julieetchitv @ITV  hate this cheap shot journalism with Rudd ..
Who is this woman on @ITV interviewing @AmberRudd_MP - stop trying to blame the police! Amber Rudd getting arsey with her!!!!!!
@CoraAandD @antanddec @ITVNightlyShow @radioleary @ITV I try to record it and put it on YouTube!
Good to hear @AmberRudd_MP talking about excellent work of #police and intelligence services as @ITV seek to blame "failures" on #protectors
All the awful mp's on TV   amber rudd   warsi    horrible folk    I don't want to see them    @ITV and @Channel4News  get some nice folk on
