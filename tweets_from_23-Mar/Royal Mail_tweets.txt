@RoyalMail Your tracker says my parcel RS483207939GB was attempted for delivery yesterday, untrue. Call me on +27713716099 for re-delivery.
@RoyalMail what details do you need? And will logging it actually do anything?
Huge thanks to @RoyalMail üôèüèªfor ensuring safe delivery of passport application even after I was so stupid to post without stamp on envelope
@RoyalMail I sent a parcel off one week ago and it's still saying you have it, why has it not been sent ?

@gwenbdm @RoyalMail well someone has an attitude.
@RoyalMail I would like to find out where my package is. It says it was delivered yesterday at 6:45am which is not the case.
@expressivekim @EleanaClaire @RoyalMail wow that's bad
@PostOffice @RoyalMail Also, please signpost me to the guidance which sets out this policy.
@PostOffice @RoyalMail My complaint is DEFINITELY with the Post Office. I shall be making a complaint about YOU as you are totally unhelpful
@RoyalMail The postmen/women who serve Longstomps Avenue (Chelmsford) are awesome - they consistently do a great job, pls thank their depot.
@Jeromesh68 We wouldn't be able to assist you with this complaint as this isn't one of our policies it is @RoyalMail ~ Luke
@RoyalMail  so how/when do I get my compensation?
Sorry @RoyalMail it was @DPD_UK who came at 7.30am! Who rings the doorbell at bloody 7.30am!? Please don't come the same time tomorrow
@RoyalMail  Could you please help with  my missing parcel - RY002568655CH. Thanks
@RoyalMail 2/2 if there was no return address will they still have it? Can you trace it for me with the reference?
@RoyalMail 1/2 just found out sm1 sent me a parcel over 3 weeks ago rcrded, I didn't get a card, my post depot hasn't answered my 15 calls.
@RoyalMail expect live tracking info more up to date than card so if website says Available for collection then that's what I believe
@RoyalMail Just wanted to say thanks for not getting Mass Effect today as it says delivered but not received.
@RoyalMail I have every time to no avail. Parcels being signed for using a fake signature, and being left with neighbours with no card
@badgerwatcher1 @RoyalMail yes please do as I'm fed up of all the red bands outside my front door

@RoyalMail you left my parcel with a neighbour this morning but didn't tell me what number of house or which neighbour?

@ChadLeech @RoyalMail Hi there, apologies, we can not guarantee delivery on release date with Standard Shipping.
@RoyalMail no it didn't just an empty envelope !
@RoyalMail for the first parcel or the second?
@RoyalMail So if postie can't be arsed to try neighbours or place in safe location I have to visit sorting office, great service
@AmazonHelp It wouldn't be the first time, sadly. I get stuff from you often but it's been years since @royalmail has been the carrier
Seems @RoyalMail don't have the nominated a neighbour or safe place option anyone, told its up to Posties discretion.

Second damaged envelop in 2 days.  Not happy with @RoyalMail at the moment

Can someone just not phone or email me about it instead? Would be a lot less hassle
Appalling @RoyalMail deliver item to wrong address twice. Week later say been returned both times and they can't trace which depo has it now

What's the point in a preordering if you don't receive it the day it comes out ? @SmythsToysUK @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail your staff in the delivery office will want to know when the customer goes in and they can't find the parcel. They need a phone!
@RoyalMail I also need to get the parcel I should have collected - I wanted it redelivered tomorrow.
@RoyalMail your staff gave me the wrong parcel (I was collecting 3) So another customer will be going to collect and no parcel will be there

@RoyalMail I tried 5 attempts and your web site didn't recognise it what an I supposed to do ?
@RoyalMail Thank you for being so careful with my post. A large parcel disappears and you fail to find it. I hope whoever has it, enjoys it.
@RoyalMail Im expecting a parcel to be delivered today &amp; it has been ready for delivery since 5:30 AM. Could you tell me what's going on?
@RoyalMail Yes I am the sender.

@RoyalMail Could I DM you about a query about track and tracing post?
@RoyalMail seems very coincidental. So I'd like to know how I get this investigated? Don't want to arrange any more deliveries at the mo!

@RoyalMail as two deliveries from unrelated senders and they've both gone missing / missed etas.
@RoyalMail sorry. One was from start of March and I emailed senders to chase. One was last week which made me think it's a mail problem now
@Prickles54 @RoyalMail @hedgehogsociety  We are so lucky with our pstie, he is very aware and never drops his bands. Good chap.
