@ITV #VERA Catchup. Great.... But... 18 named male characters only 4 female named characters. WHY? No female police speaking parts.
So no podium interviews either @channel5_tv #MexicoCityePrix 

Wow. Miss @ITV

@thevoiceuk @ITV @Intothearkmusic @imjustcalledmo @jamiemillmusic shame the real talent went out last week.
There's no way @meeshjohn deserved to leave @thevoiceuk. Let's see the voter numbers, @ITV. #fix
@ITV he will be the winner, he's the total package.
@PixieLott @thevoiceuk @AntonPowers @ITV pixie you got the lott. Stunning performance.
@nubasutra @ITV Totally agree
