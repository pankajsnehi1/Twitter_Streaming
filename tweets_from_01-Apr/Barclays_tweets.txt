Shout out to that @BarclaysUK call centre worker for trying her hardest to be as unhelpful as possible.
@BarclaysUK attention needed at your Harrow branch. 3 people serving a queue of &gt;50 people. Customer service poor.
@BarclaysUK 27 minutes waiting on your mortgage line.  You answer then hang up.
Been on hold for 19:40 mins to @BarclaysUK  "premier" line. I think it speaks volumes.
@NetflixUK if you will not accept the 3 digits @BarclaysUK have put on my card that EVERYONE else accepts what would you like? My ovaries?
Waiting around for machines in @BarclaysUK annoys annoys, got pulled out the counter queue and now two of them are down..
@BarclaysUK disgusted with how you are treating my fraud cause - terrible customer service. After a week and not an inch of progression #sad
