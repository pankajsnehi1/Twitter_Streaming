@SkyUK why do u keep messing up? my games and phone are lagging so much.
@SkyHelpTeam @skyuk I've been a customer for 16 years. Why do you consistently ignore my tweets about your buggy Sky+ iPhone app?

@SkyUK I would like an email address for a complaint please..not getting the service told to us! Thanks
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam
@SkyUK's customer service is appalling!! Wifi down for nearly a month, but it's literally a laughing matter for them???😡
I can't believe @SkyUK has removed The Walking Dead off box sets! How am I suppose to watch it now! 😩
@SkyUK why have you taken seasons 1-6 of The Walking Dead off Sky Boxsets? What kind of sick April fools joke is this?!
@LFC 2-1 @Everton @premierleague @SkyFootball good game more importantly the new @SkyUK Go app update for @Android is siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!!

@skyuk need to sort their online streaming out. No Chrome support and going around in circles on Firefox
@SkyUK so after giving 31 days notice, coming back but changed mind to be told I have to give 31 days notice again? No cooling off period?
Ahh @SkyUK loving the fact it's April 1st? https://t.co/tWRUhFMQNY
changing from @SkyUK to @SkyUK makes you loose your internet connection for 3 days. Seriously ??
.@SkyUK What am i supposed to do with this? https://t.co/7LN97qUQPV
FFS, @SkyUK Cant watch things online and cant alter my stupid shield to enable me to use my broadband which i pay for
@SkyUK When I watch Live TV on the SkyGo app on my Xbox the picture is constantly blurry, how do I get the picture quality that I pay for?
@SkyUK I cancelled my subscription in October but I still get letter at least every other week...any way to stop this? It's annoying now
Thanks @SkyUK you've made me download a desktop player for #skygo and now it counts as a new device #MerseysideDerby on the iPad now 😡😡😡😡
@SkyUK really annoyed with sky customer service it's so rubbish! They've overcharged me even though I notified them of the mistake!
Tune into @prayerhouseuk #PrayerLine tonight from 9:30pm-11pm GMT. On @olivetvukcom @SkyUK (Channel 593) 📺💻📱
@SkyUK played a cruel April Fools on us today. Told us they were coming to connect us between 8-10 today and they are nowhere to be seen.
Worked out why @SkyUK fees are so expensive. Never been so popular since leaving them.
I'll have to go to the pub early because sky fibre isn't working AGAIN. Haway lads @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam https://t.co/IYTC1Ipw5W

I'm on s6ep11 of @WalkingDead_AMC and @SkyUK have taken it off box sets
You got me into it
@DavidinRTW @SkyUK Sky is generally one of the most unstable and badly managed services I have ever experienced.

.@SkyBroadband @SkyUK tell me that if the wifi doesn't work it's not their problem and will charge me to fix it #topservice
@SkyUK camron the manager has awful customer service and closed my complaint when I'm still not happy !!! JOKE
@kelly_welles @DeborahFW @bishakali @SkyUK @TigerAspectUK It's nice as audio only! TV will mean pictures and it being less indy/secret
@SkyUK why has The Walking Dead now only showing series 7? All series were there yesterday but now gone? What's going on?
@SkyUK I have to take time off work now, but have to pay sky for my sky q install, does this seem acceptable? #unfair
Another house move another pathetic effort from @SkyUK 🙄 Not sure why I've agreed to an 18 month contract when you can't turn our service on
