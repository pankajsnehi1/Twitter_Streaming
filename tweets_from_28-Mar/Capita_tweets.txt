@V4Services and @CapitaPlc are just two of the #PrivateSector organisations benefiting from Verto's #CollaborativeWorkingTools.
@Capita_SA @CapitaPlc @O2 @CPWTweets The point of maternity payout is to assist mums at their most vulnerable time while they're out of work
@Capita_SA @CapitaPlc @O2 @CPWTweets Furthermore, when new mums return to work, you inform them that they somehow owe YOU money. Horrendous!
@Capita_SA @CapitaPlc @O2 @CPWTweets Both lies. You promise payout upon RETURN to work (which defeats purpose) then refuse to pay out.
