@DirectLine_UK just the app
@DirectLine_UK Portal...? The app works but it's not been tracking anything since mid Feb.
@DirectLine_UK hello, my Drive Plus app doesn't seem to track my journeys any more. Any suggestions?
@DirectLine_UK thank you I will...
@DirectLine_UK I've already got my insurance with you, might be getting a newer car tomorrow...
@DirectLine_UK okay thank you. I'll let your team review in the first instance. Issue is with the company you use &amp; not @DirectLine_UK

@DirectLine_UK do you offer track day insurance?
@DirectLine_UK just felt it was appropriate to credit where it was due.
@DirectLine_UK thanks for this it's currently being resolved through customer service. I can't fault you but the company you use for heating
@BritishGasHelp had a call out yesterday - amazing service and resolved the issues. Other companies couldn't resolve @DirectLine_UK
@DirectLine_UK pleased to say it was sorted by the morning, not the incredible service I'm used to though, bit of an indirect line this time

@DirectLine_UK Amy, I'm no, I just want to save a quote. Is there a technical person I can speak to?
@DirectLine_UK Amy, to register you need an 'Online customer Code', but to get an Online Code you need a Policy Number!! So I'm stuck.
@DirectLine_UK No message, i'm stuck in a loop. As Registration needs a Online Customer Code. And saving requires a Password! I have neither
@DirectLine_UK i'm confused!  I can't save a car insurance quote if I dont already have any policy with you? very frustrating website
