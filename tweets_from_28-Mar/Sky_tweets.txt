Got no internet (üò´üò∞) whilst I wait for a new @SkyUK router so I'll be basically silent for a couple of days. #skybroadband #NoInternet
@SkyUK I prefer if it went straight to tv guide tbh
@SkyUK Is there a problem with your broadband in Northampton? Ours hasn't worked for more than an hour over the last 10days! @DaViEs86
@JohnWilliams004 @ComedyCentralUK @SkyUK good little peg for a gratuitous plug! Great work John...
As #FreshPrince has been trending about a possible reunion; a reminder that you can catch classic episodes on @ComedyCentralUK via @SkyUK
@SkyUK #fluidviewing love skyQ
@SkyUK Your app isn't workin for me... any solutions? https://t.co/RCz46AQHaK
@BTCare spoke to your billing team @SkyUK haven't cancelled anything with you like they said they would. At least you have responded!!
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam  #skyukripoff #skyukfail https://t.co/oP4pizJV50
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam poor customer service 5 days without a reply. Why have you put my broadband up without telling me?
#CreativeismMovement And if BIG MEDIA decide to silence You, they do it like a single body. From @afneil @BBC to @adamboultonSKY @SkyUK etc.
@SkyUK when you have been with SKY 7 years and they can't even fix an issue THEY are responsible for! ROLL ON end of contract!#neveragain
I can't believe @SkyUK cancelled #DesiRascals after Amitabh Bachchan came on the show.
@SkyUK 6 days later and no one has contacted me in regards to my query on free sky Q installation. What a great service . üëéüëéüëéüëé
@virginmedia Have you got a link for offers for your existing customers?? If  I can't get another offer sorted out I'll be back @SkyUK
@Elessarion30 @SkyUK coming from a old sky customer i had problems with them everyday, have a word with @virginmedia awesome folk
Argh Internet connection down again. Second time this month. Hopefully it's just @SkyUK doing maintenance again...
Trying to sort out my set up date for @SkyUK üò° why don't they just give you one &amp; then if you can't do that day THEN call up to change it?!
@SkyUK amazing lady on your helpline last night who got our internet working again. So helpful and informative. You should be proud of her
#WalkingDead time, love you @SkyUK +
@SkyUK I don't really want a homepage. Will there be a way of switching it off or going straight to recordings?
@bigjonesy1 @SkyUK only on to the sixth person as it's nothing to do with their team. Only Been with them two months!
@danslevin @vincristine comparing costs: @SKYNZ basic $49 a month https://t.co/sj5tiW8eQE @SkyUK basic $19 a month https://t.co/72SMoXqeE7
@jridsdill @SkyUK I fucked em off last year rizza, was on top package for over 15 years aswel
@julesmarie321 @SkyUK bugger i was just thinking about‚Äãcoming back to sky as @EE  broadband is dog muck
.@BTCare ...for long enough and will be switching to @SkyUK if this can't be resolved.
What a shambles @SkyUK are. Very bad customer service, bad choice by me to use them as a provider! Direct debit will be cancelled!
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam why have I been told there are outages in the area but the status pages say no issues? I need the internet at home!
@_SophieHoward_ @SkyUK tweet @SkyHelpTeam they should reply
@fairydustie71 @SkyUK @virginmedia @NOWTV Oo thank you I will have a look! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@SkyUK it is affecting my ability to do uni work! So need it sorted ASAP (3)
@skyuk #SkyEngineers bonus structure is based on lies and manipulation. Every year the bonus structure changes to make room for more lies.
Apparently there are outages in the area but the status pages are not reporting any issues! @SkyUK (2)
We have amazing offers on @SkyUK, get in contact with our team today to join! #SkyTV https://t.co/HVJh9F8Aik https://t.co/A1CQ41qldi

#Bullying #Harassment Team Managers @SkyUK Mock, discriminate and take advantage of people with mental health issues....
@CKELLY_BB @SkyUK try @virginmedia and @NOWTV for sky much cheaper x
Good luck to chef Steve Chapman finalist in #StrEATFoodAwards today @Gatherandgather @SkyUK
@SkyUK disappointing service. Back to virgin
This morning we're at an In Conversation events with Jeremy Darroch, Group Chief Executive of @SkyUK https://t.co/THgybO9tLj
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam guys ?
@TalkTalk doesn't connect at all. We've had enough now, never had any of these problems with @SkyUK or @virginmedia
@georgeroberts_ @SkyUK I think you look more like  a Title than a George to be honest ü§î
Moving house is great until you look at how expensive @SkyUK is üò©
@SkyUK so why did the engineer arrive 08:05? https://t.co/rsHst1Z4nu
@virginmedia 11 days is not asap is it, is disgraceful I have not had 1 call from you. So glad to be with @SkyUK  put your service to shame
@SkyUK #SkyEngineers not given enough time to install SkyQ. Team Managers are pressuring engineers to install SkyQ within 90min. Barbaric
@SkyUK #skyfieldengineers promotion is none existent unless your morbidly obese then you will be promoted out of the way.
@SkyUK #Wirral Team Managers have bullied 3 members of staff and all 3 have quit their job.
#bullying @SkyUK 9 Engineers on the #Wirral suffer from Mental Health. Work Related.
@OpenreachGB well, @SkyUK are obviously not that bothered, and @OpenreachGB not very capable neither #1WonthWithoutInternet
@SkyUK are absolutely shocking. Trying to speak to them since 5pm last night about cancelling crap 2.5mb internet... apparently too busy
#Skyegineers Risk their life daily to complete installations, cutting corners with health and safety to complete sales targets. @SkyUK
@georgeroberts_ @SkyUK Been with them since day one. So pissed off with new customer giveaways of TVs and deals. We're off to @virginmedia
@georgeroberts_ @SkyUK They sent me an email (To Yahoo email) saying I hadn't used my SkyEmail for over a year, I didn't know I had one
Interested enough to not even personalise this email @SkyUK?! Clearly my monthly payments and 8 years of loyalty do‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eGQR2885bq
