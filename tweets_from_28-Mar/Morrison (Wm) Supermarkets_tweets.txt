@Morrisons thankyou. The food was lovely will definitely be back.
@Morrisons it's still not there but it doesn't matter because Morrisons version is cheaper and just as nice :)
@Morrisons it's Portsmouth but the fruit is prepacked so it's not a store issue other places are the same just wish the grapes were sliced
@Morrisons Thanks that'd be good. I asked today &amp; staff said they "can't say". Some food did have allergy info on the label...
@Morrisons thank you :)
@Morrisons just bought meal deal in Letchworth but no reduction on bill.  Charged £15. No-one answering phone at store, not good.

Hi @Morrisons Would you consider labelling the relevant food in your salad bar as vegetarian/vegan? Or having a nutritional guide for it?
@Morrisons then again the store also had no bananas out. Maybe they just aren't very good at keeping on top of things.
@Morrisons I think the manager is lying to you if they say that organic milk is on display in that shop.

@Morrisons I'm compiling a list of Easter opening hours for Birmingham Supermarkets. Can you please tell me what these will be? thanks
@Morrisons Heywood. I understand what you say but offering quorn when asked about GF??  Not exactly what one would expect!!
@Morrisons Hi Morrisons, half your trolleys at your Witham store have rubbish in them. Am I expected to put my food… https://t.co/JKYQ3DkqHZ
Sampling sesh under way @Morrisons #Harrogate and they've put me by the booze and crisps. Happy days! #DairyFree 🍦 https://t.co/yVHAAo5HTy
@Morrisons if a meal is inedibile due to quality you should get a full refund for all components not just told tough eat the side dish!
@Morrisons appears if you meal is terrible you get a refund for the part that rubbish.  The side dishes that make up your meal NO tough luck
@Morrisons yes they gave us £5. Not good enough
@Morrisons I'm guessing this isn't genuine ? https://t.co/RmRlAkshBY
@Morrisons np19 0ra
I do not approve of @Morrisons own brands peanuts
@TooGoodToBeUK went to @Morrisons for breakfast, my wife asks can you do gf?  Answer was we have quorn sausages instead of meat🙄🤔
@Morrisons any response yet???
@pinkiebag @Morrisons Thanks for linking up with #TwinklyTuesday - have a fab day 😁
@Morrisons please thank Clifton for being really happy and smiley in delivery of my food today 😊 makes such a difference! #LittleThings
@Morrisons phew panic over!! Thanks!
@Tesco @sainsburys @asda @Morrisons @waitrose hand out tokens to customers surely much cheaper than replacing £1 trolley locks?
@AnjAvraam @TheVeganSociety @Morrisons @coopuk Morrisons only allow the use of natural flavourings in their own label products :)

@Morrisons I'm good too thanks! :)
@RebeccaLHuggins @TheVeganSociety @Morrisons @coopuk If they make them in store, they don't need to list ingredients, just allergens! :)
@morrisons Sidcup.  Please remove trolley on corner of Rectory avenue and Selborne road (high street end) and RECOIN trolleys now!!!
@Morrisons We're so grateful for your support!  Thank you, from everyone here at PARC :)
@Morrisons Thanks, we dealt with it in store but wanted to flag as this seems to be a considerable problem where gfree food is concerned
@Morrisons it is indeed. Berwick Hills store said no longer selling, only selling uncoated tablets 😷
Mmm @Morrisons "Aweetcorn".
I hope they take more care with handling &amp; hygiene than they do with labelling. Hardly… https://t.co/uiKi1ACFOg
@Morrisons sent you a dm
@lifeway_kefir @Morrisons Are these cultures harmful to people who have had transplants?
@Morrisons Morrisons Corporation Road. Amazing that it's spilled and still it comes to the top of the bottle. Don't… https://t.co/HLEbAmgmBW
@Morrisons Good morning! How are you? :)
@Morrisons horrible service, they offered me £2 voucher with a 2 week wait. I'm extremely disappointed with Morrisons delivery service.
@Morrisons sent you another DM Saturday? No reply ??
@mohicankid @Morrisons how thick are they ?
@Morrisons no I didn't, but won't be too hard to track it down. Surely smoking in a lorry cab is illegal? And with headphones in! Horrendous
@TheVeganSociety @nigel4036 @Morrisons @coopuk I've had to ask before as I wasn't sure. Co-op jam doughnuts all the way! Thanks Co-op 😘
But in all seriousness, shame on @Tesco @coopuk @sainsburys @asda @Morrisons etc for failing to refuse to sell #Legsit edition of the Mail
@Morrisons thanks for giving me my money's worth in squash but now I've gotta clean up the sticky mess. https://t.co/mzGrucboAh
We'll be @Morrisons #Harrogate this morning from 10am handing out free samples of our delicious #DairyFree ice crea… https://t.co/Pn7JPbyaHR
@Morrisons all because I've had the respect not to chuck it on the road. Into the 5th week of contact now and it's… https://t.co/MmAQRdFwaU
@Morrisons Hello. Sent 3 messages yesterday with no response. Still waiting for the Trolley in my back garden to be collected. 1/2
New pound coin...in the near future how we going to use shopping trollies? @Morrisons @AsdaServiceTeam @Tesco @sainsburys @waitrose?
@Morrisons thanks for replying.  They were a gift off my daughter so unfortunately she took the sticker off before… https://t.co/eGBrx2YJsX
@TheVeganSociety Serious allergen risk there @Morrisons :/ Learn from @coopuk
@getsurrey @Morrisons @AllisonFerns1
Will @Morrisons ever understand social media? https://t.co/T1tc69Pefy
@Morrisons they're still there!! https://t.co/PQ5XgBIaec
@BBCBreakfast @LGANews @morrisons love their Potholes at Pakefield branch happy 2 let customers damage their cars https://t.co/qCluI3hL0j
@Morrisons great thanks, I have DMed you
@antoneath @Morrisons I can imagine your desperation growing as each shop didn't have it in stock 😆😆
@morrisons try viewing the convo
@TheVeganSociety @Morrisons @coopuk I'm more concerned about the flavoring and kind of preservative 🤢🤢🤢
