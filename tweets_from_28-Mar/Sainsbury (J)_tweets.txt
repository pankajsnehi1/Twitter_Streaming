I've had a good start to the day. Was asked for ID in @sainsburys, I said "I first voted in '97". "You've got a baby face" was the reply. 👏🏾
@sainsburys It's not true that your own-brand sunflower spread is being discontinued, is it? 😯
They would be a big mention on our site and its all for a good cause. Please let me know if this could be possible @sainsburys 

Thanks

@sainsburys hi Robbie, looks like you don't stock them at all!!! Tesco does.
@sainsburys Linlithgow. They were a mothers day present
@hollowlegs @sainsburys oh god. I guess "dim sum" now occupies the same meaningless supermarket language space as tapas ("small food")
@sainsburys @manchesterfire appalled your doors are chained shut when the store is open to the public. What happens in the event of a fire?
@sainsburys sent thanks!
@sainsburys can you start selling the Eat Real Hummus Chips in your Bognor Regis!!

@sainsburys Is there something wrong with your 'My coupons' site? I keep getting a picture superimposed over the login screen.

@queencharlot @asda @Tesco @sainsburys Absolutely. It's an industrialised farming issue. This is standard practice sadly.
