The fine for @Tesco is a ludicrous amount.
Our government have swindled for years.
And been fined by Brussels themselves!
@BBCBreaking @Tesco If only individuals could 'agree' to pay a fine and choose if they're to be prosecuted for breaking the law.

Personally think SFO should have prosecuted @Tesco. Wrong message given to firms that knowingly defraud shareholders
@illandancient @Tesco that's a very big difference. Interesting

@BBCBreaking @Tesco It's not a fine if it hasn't been before a court of law?More like a bribe
@BBCBreaking @Tesco The penalty must be paid by management who committed that crime ! Why penalize share-holders?!

@Tesco @kukuliitiis I want a gift card :( 
Us students have to unite together ya know #lonely
@Tesco see or select offers that are currently not available, but will be on that date. Only offers that will expire on 28/03, not v.helpful
@Tesco and that future offers aren't shown and available to select for the delivery date booked. e.g., my delivery date is 30/03, I can't
@Tesco hi, the app is up to date, this is a programming oversight, no one has thought to set it so that offers that will expire don't appear
@Tesco Nice one! Good service and help from staff on the shop floor, so all is well again.

Tesco is really good Tristan
@Tesco Sorry but my daughter and I commented on how friendly she was. Not getting her told off for that. Thanks for replying.
@Tesco Check your inbox, just sent in the details ‚ù§Ô∏è Making students happy, nice one üòä
@Tesco it wasn't JUST displaying RUST on the tin but ALSO the peas were DISCOLOURED !!
@Tesco It would be sensible to set it so it shows offers that are available on the date you've booked, will have check again after 28th now.
@Tesco 2/2 have to edit your order at checkout because the offers you've selected won't be available by the time of delivery.
@Tesco Hi, any chance your app can be updated to show offers that are in date on the booked deliver day date? It's rather frustrating to 1/2
@Tesco  I've sent you a DM with my details as requested, I WANT the supplier to contact me regarding the RUSTY tin.
@Tesco the best reward would be a cheeky Tesco gift card üòèüòèüòè
@Tesco thank you!
@Tesco they also offered to call an ambulance and didn't charge for her purchase
@Tesco üòÉüòÜ
@Tesco just let the store know we are highly grateful. They came to her assistance and saw if she was okay before getting her a wheelchair
@SianAffonso @Tesco all it would take is one careless driver. I'm surprised this near miss hasn't been reported before
