.@Tesco maybe train your staff to not be such racist bigots and your managers to not be tolerant and complicit in this disgusting behaviour.
@Tesco, is this a new storage technique you're told to do by head office? https://t.co/NiGBlCqT2G
.@Tesco can people not even do their shopping anymore without being racially abused? This wasn't even the first I've heard of this behaviour
.@Tesco not even have the capacity to learn their email addresses correctly? Egham is a university town with hundreds of non-White students
@Tesco hi they were bought on Sunday for Mothers day at the meadows camberley by my son for approx £10
.@Tesco not only did the manager not interfere, but she gave my friend's mother the wrong email address to log a complaint. Do your managers

Good on your Mr Godfrey. @tesco #clueless BBC News - Devon farmer challenges Tesco over promotional picture https://t.co/ze2GKmsqZT
@Tesco When you say unable, you mean as long as they're buying from us. It should be stopped its a fucking disgrace
@JSutliffFitness @UfitDrinks @Tesco @Protein_Chef @teladams I love that I can get these from Tesco and dont have to go out of my way
@Tesco a week later and still out of order #notimpressed
"Deliver without bags", yet 12 arrive, most half empty, complete with brilliantly ironic branding. Disappointing la… https://t.co/D4ujft4PIM
HUMFH. Apparently @Tesco have no delivery slots available all week.
@Tesco ol2 7pf, 9:50pm
@Tesco I have a click+collect arriving in your Stevenage store today. How long will it be held for as I can't collect it until tomorrow. X
@Tesco they were from Tesco extra in abingdon https://t.co/Ohy6vXrijb
@Tesco Thanks Cameron, I've DM'd you the store details 👍 Look forward to hearing from you.
@Tesco had to call 3times to get info about my online delivery,and finally got delayed two days later.what kind of poor service is that?
@Tesco yeah that's fine 😊 thanks!
@TheGoonerette @Tesco these things happen.  Remember, local sewer isn't too far from there. Jerry just wanted an adventure.

@Tesco I've sent you a DM regarding the RUSTY tin of Peas. Thanks 😀
@Tesco DM Sent!
@Tesco wasn't there
@Tesco thanks Aggi
@Tesco @kukuliitiis I want a gift card :( 
Us students have to unite together ya know #lonely
@Tesco see or select offers that are currently not available, but will be on that date. Only offers that will expire on 28/03, not v.helpful
@Tesco and that future offers aren't shown and available to select for the delivery date booked. e.g., my delivery date is 30/03, I can't
@Tesco hi, the app is up to date, this is a programming oversight, no one has thought to set it so that offers that will expire don't appear
@Tesco Nice one! Good service and help from staff on the shop floor, so all is well again.

@Crazed5467 especially of its in @Tesco @tesconews @TescoOffersMore @tescomobile @TescoClubcardUK @TescoIrl

Tesco is really good Tristan
@Tesco Sorry but my daughter and I commented on how friendly she was. Not getting her told off for that. Thanks for replying.
@Tesco Check your inbox, just sent in the details ❤️ Making students happy, nice one 😊
@Tesco it wasn't JUST displaying RUST on the tin but ALSO the peas were DISCOLOURED !!
@Tesco It would be sensible to set it so it shows offers that are available on the date you've booked, will have check again after 28th now.
@Tesco 2/2 have to edit your order at checkout because the offers you've selected won't be available by the time of delivery.
@Tesco Hi, any chance your app can be updated to show offers that are in date on the booked deliver day date? It's rather frustrating to 1/2
@Tesco  I've sent you a DM with my details as requested, I WANT the supplier to contact me regarding the RUSTY tin.
@Tesco the best reward would be a cheeky Tesco gift card 😏😏😏
@Tesco thank you!
@Tesco they also offered to call an ambulance and didn't charge for her purchase
@Tesco 😃😆
@Tesco just let the store know we are highly grateful. They came to her assistance and saw if she was okay before getting her a wheelchair
@SianAffonso @Tesco all it would take is one careless driver. I'm surprised this near miss hasn't been reported before
@MAnnaliese @TescoIrl @Tesco @tesconews #SHAME !!!
Please @Tesco in Redcar. Sort this out! @RedcarCleveland https://t.co/BqXzTSndZM
@PyroAIt @Tesco your smart, your loyal, I appreciate that!
@Tesco I keep getting calls from ".com" asking for a mechanic 🙄 not sure why they call me but just letting you know x
@Tesco thank you 😄
@Tesco your security guards think they're Conor McGregor
@Tesco you've always got my back homie
