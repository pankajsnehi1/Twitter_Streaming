@easyJet Bonjour. Pouvez-vous me confirmer les dimensions max pour un bagage à main et si en plus un sac à main/dos est autorisé ? Merci !
@easyJet my friend bought my plane ticket. How do I sign up for access to your mobile app so I can check in online? there is no link
The beauty of flying low-cost in Europe 🙌🏼✈️ @easyJet
https://t.co/FpVzGvHeTC
@easyJet disappointed with the service from this company, exactly  3 hours delay  on the flight  , then a 4.50 voucher which didn't work 😂😂😂
@DuncanBannatyne @easyJet the same way you get off with a broken sauna for the last 5 months in your gym 🙂
@DuncanBannatyne @easyJet Why would you fly @easyJet? You get what you pay for.
@DuncanBannatyne @easyJet Same way they've always got off.....lock door give it 5 mins &amp; yeeha your in the mile high club
Bonne nuit @easyJet. Moi j'arrive à 4h à la maison. #easyjet https://t.co/VG69y1Krhy
We fly with @easyJet at least twice a month and love them! We had a lovely flight again this evening☺
Thanks to the Twilight Bag Drop by @easyJet, we don't have to drag our luggage around all night. The sleepless wait just got so much easier!
A big thank to the @easyJet staff that kindly, fast and hours before our flight w @LuzDLuna  helped us drop our baggage at @Gatwick_Airport
@easyJet my friend is flying from Newcastle - Geneva on Monday, please can you give me the flight number?
5 hours late but finally back to Portugal. Thank God. F#%# @easyJet .
@easyJet hi, I did that &amp; it won't let me add luggage. When I click on the link it takes me back to the log in page &amp; go round in a circle 😑
@easyJet How do I immediately change a booking which has jumped a week ahead of a return date I am after without being ripped off?
Just booked my next Parisienne adventure with @easyJet &amp; @LesPiaules - Can't wait for June!
@easyJet thanks, will do 😊
@Bolinnette @easyJet Bonjour, au-delà de 3h de retard, vous pouvez prétendre à une indemnité. Plus d'infos ici :
https://t.co/idNoTLQH0C
@easyJet btw, that nearly led to all the passengers having to identify their bags on the tarmac, 1970s style.
@easyJet Thanks Phil. You can refund me the £35 I had to pay when your whizzy new automated baggage system double counted one of our bags
Absolute joke @easyjet Won't pay expenses after cancelling flight to LPL. Flew me to GLA instead. Cost of fuel from GLA to LPL claim denied.
'Will the passengers requiring wheelchair assistance please remain seated.' @easyJet is Frankie Boyle writing your announcements?
@easyJet more horrendous customer service from easyJet how do they get away with treating customers this way???

@easyJet Great response. Hope your next flight is better. Not Sorry for the inconvenience, we will try &amp; ensure it foes not happen again.
@easyJet can you fly within U.K. with driving licence? While your passport is being renewed...? 🤔
@JonLewis_Hoi @easyJet thanks for your reply, Jonathan. A lot quicker and comprehensive than easy jet.
@easyJet Just wanted to say how fab Gemma was on the Venice to Luton flight! Great cabin manager!
@DuncanBannatyne @easyJet flew back to Cyprus with Thomas Cook today, now that's a bad airline.

@easyJet oh, and maybe if you didn't charge such extortionate prices for checking in bags you wouldn't have to bully ppl into checking
@BenoitGx @easyJet Je propose une nouvelle règle : ne jamais reprendre #EasyJet et bien le conseiller à tout le monde.

First time flying with @easyJet tomorrow! Get me out of here! Anyone else flown with them before? What they like? #Aviation #Easyjet
@easyJet It was 9.05 in the end. Was super confusing though.
@hahoAnna @Ryanair @easyJet Yep, and live chat only answer every question with 'you have to pay the flight change fee's'
@easyJet why does your website quote £35 each way for ski boots but when trying to add to a booking it charges £105?
@DuncanBannatyne @easyJet Because people keep using them, fly another airline..
@DanTheYid_ @Ryanair @easyJet but why? They don't need to charge that! They're fleecing you there. Totally ridiculous mate
@bea_lily okay! @easyJet sort it out
@hahoAnna @Ryanair @easyJet I even said i'm happy to pay the difference in fares (£40) but they want to charge me £330 in total
@DanTheYid_ @Ryanair @easyJet bloody ridiculous! 😡 they won't just let you swap them for a change fee? It's crazy?

@hahoAnna @Ryanair @easyJet Nope, its a joke. Spent thousands with them over last few years, but still they fleece regular customers 😡
@easyJet Why no food vouchers for 3 hr delay at Bristol yesterday? Plus, having no crew after being called to gate is chaotic. Upset many..
@easyJet staff don't even know about the delay ,called to gate 17:20 but on app the Aircraft was still in Scotland! 18:41 still no update
@easyJet awful Customer service @ LTN. Staff clueless, boards still say depart 17:40, staff say 10 mins delay. Your app says 1 hour 25 delay
@easyJet Home safe just a bit late. Pilot was a gent though!!! 🙌🏼
@DuncanBannatyne @easyJet bedpan for Duncan
@easyJet no thanks, we have arrived home now #EC261 claim already in

@DanTheYid_ @Ryanair @easyJet You're joking right? Bloody cheek of them.
Just noticed that @easyJet are doing flights to Berlin from Ncl again? Why did noone tell me! Time to book those Sept flights ✈️ #takemehome
So @Ryanair want to charge me £330 to move my flights forward 1 weekend, only paid £150 for them. Its cheaper to buy new ones from @easyJet
When you fly with @easyJet you're guaranteed to NOT take off on time.
@Nat_Summers @TicketmasterUK @easyJet @Drake why didn't he turn up Nat?!
@easyJet ta. Flight was fine. Just a bit late. No idea why they kept announcing the flight that was gone and landed already!

@easyJet Hi, was there a problem with your website yesterday? Tried to add hold luggage to a flight but the process failed.
@easyJet there seems to be a glitch in the system. The flight was in 2.5 hours. Just wanted to let you know that your policy is misleading
@easyJet hello! When will flights up the 14th Feb 2018 be on sale please? ☺

@easyJet excellent. Thank you
@easyJet worst customer service.
@easyJet onto my journey home. Didn't end up making my dads birthday - absolutely gutted. Nothing but a bad experience using easyJet!
@easyJet shock - delayed and then to make matters worse we had to put our hand luggage in the hold-all which meant adding another 50 mins
@easyJet on our return flight back I was hoping all would run smooth as it was my dad's 50th birthday in which we was all going out for food
@easyJet we luckily managed to get on, but having to wait around for an hour not knowing if I'm flying is appalling
@easyJet with flying anyway and then I'm told this as I'm waiting to board my plane?? Absolutely disgusting service
@easyJet as a present for my boyfriend. Was told that the flight had been over-booked and we didn't have a seat! Suffer really bad anxiety

@easyJet shed any light on why 3132 from Geneva to stansted is delayed 3 hours? As usual 0 info from anyone at the actual airport
@easyJet help anyone..not too complicated..but kind of urgent
@easyJet no I was 2 minutes late after gate closed wasn't allowed on, therefore my outbound and return flights not used - what's next?
@easyJet Not really. My flight was delayed by 7+ hours, but you're claiming it wasn't delayed. Can't wait to ring you later 😀
What is this bullshit you can't even take a small handbag with your suitcase to keep passports etc in? @easyJet 👎🏼
