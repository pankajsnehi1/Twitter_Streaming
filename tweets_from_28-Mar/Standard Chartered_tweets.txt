@LFC @StanChart @olawoyeseun3 best goal for Liverpool that march.
@LFC @StanChart wiynaldum was very good to
@LFC @StanChart i thought we were good this month 2 wins and a draw mane was my player of the month he was fantastic
@LFC @StanChart Probably Mane. Can't think of many though tbh. I thought we were pretty horrible this month.
@DaMonkeyPigFace @LFC @StanChart yes completely. Mignolet had an alright game tbf, but no one was good enough
@OwenSeanMurphy @LFC @StanChart fair enough. I'm sure we can agree that everyone was terrible against Leicester though, right?
@DaMonkeyPigFace @LFC @StanChart haha well, overall I think he was immense tbh, but so was Gini!!
@LFC @StanChart Gini
@OwenSeanMurphy @LFC @StanChart agree to disagree on that one. I think he did the strikers job pretty well but he didn't do his own.
@OwenSeanMurphy @LFC @StanChart he scored sure, but his defending was horrible. In my opinion, of course.
@DaMonkeyPigFace @LFC @StanChart he did his job against Burnley, and won us the game!! Okay, the strike was luck but still, we won!
@OwenSeanMurphy @LFC @StanChart I agree with you with City, I couldn't watch the Arsenal game, but I thought he was terrible against Burnley
@DaMonkeyPigFace @LFC @StanChart played well against Burnley, and Arsenal and imo good against city...
@NateLagerfeld @LFC @StanChart You think?
@OwenSeanMurphy @LFC @StanChart I think Can was all over the place this month. 1 week he'd be unbelievably good, the next unbelievably bad.
