Thanks @unitedutilities for the light and noise pollution in Bollington at 11pm #nonotice #kidsawake https://t.co/auRvsNGjX4
@unitedutilities @hacking4chorltz it's a miracle. Pure clean water. An aquifer? A holy shrine? Bottling plant? Mini Lido?
@unitedutilities Fill a jug with tap water place this in fridge, save running tap until water is cold before you fill glass #greatsummerbutt
@unitedutilities #greatsummerbutt I do the washing up in a bowl, instead of using running water when I am doing the scrubbing :)
@unitedutilities i done that earlier today, the water stayed the same for 1 hour or so, there is lots of work going on, is the water safe?
