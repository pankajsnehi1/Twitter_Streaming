Watching #BritainsBusiestMotorway @ITV - don't get #police just chucking   debris into bushes. Pick up, pop it in vehicle. Dispose! Simple.
Genuinely so upset that @ITV have decided to axe @TheHalcyon. It was a great series. I seriously hope someone else picks it up!
@MartinSLewis @ITV what about water meters when you move into a new house that has one fitted? #MartinLewis
