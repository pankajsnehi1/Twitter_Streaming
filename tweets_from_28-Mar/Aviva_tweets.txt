@KateRumTruffle have you called them, theyâ€™ll often match  @AvivaUK
@APluckyHeroine @AvivaUK I don't want to move provider but they're not leaving me much choice.
Thanks @AvivaUK, early prep for 27th May and one of the many reasons I stick with you for insurance! https://t.co/FDwQWXmyx5

@APluckyHeroine @AvivaUK that's ridiculous!!!!
@KateRumTruffle @AvivaUK they wanted to double MrSâ€™s this year. You know, given that heâ€™s an Advanced Driver with 40yrs no claimsâ€¦
So @AvivaUK are putting my insurance up Â£70 but if I go on a comparison website, the quotes are Â£200-300 less ðŸ˜’ðŸ¤”
