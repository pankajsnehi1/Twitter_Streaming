@easyJet : ik tweet het om jullie erop te wijzen dat je bijna door de ondergrens van veiligheid en comfort zakt.
unfortunately @easyJet , has more at stake, requiring an EU AOC in order to maintain most flights from 17 continental bases
@Ruth_Garside @easyJet @EverydaySexism surely it would say Dr?
@easyJet customer service brilliant 👍🏼
@Ruth_Garside @easyJet @EverydaySexism ridiculous, does it not also ask for gender when booking?
@easyJet ooo i will be thanks 👍
@SarahESeaton @easyJet @EverydaySexism No idea! It got lost between booking and boarding card.
@easyJet 3/3 staff on board made up for it though and sorted our seats so we could be together.
@easyJet  2/3 another place saying its not allowed, considering we had a two hour delay they did not have to be so rude staff on board
@Ruth_Garside @easyJet @EverydaySexism if it asked your title &amp; gave you Dr as an option why didn't it use Dr?!
@easyJet can you try make your rules apply to ALL staff at airport gates one place saying OK for hand luggage case plus small bag   1/3
Boarding pass assumes I'm male because I booked as Dr. Come on @easyJet it's 2017! @EverydaySexism https://t.co/ceuuzYpWN9
I don't mind when this happens if the flight is full, but I can see no reason here @easyJet ... #EZY8257

Seems like there is a lot of complaints on the tweeter feed for @easyjet, wonder why? Can't depend on computers and Menzies to run the show!
Why does @easyJet hide behind a third party at the airport? #menzies runs your front line? Tried to talk to ANYONE from @easyjet, no where!!
Cost me more to fly from @Gatwick_Airport to #Belfast than it took from #Canada to #London thanks @easyJet for your "low-cost" airline.
@easyJet I want to talk to someone other than #menzies. There are about x12 people at customer services @Gatwick_Airport who are LIVID
