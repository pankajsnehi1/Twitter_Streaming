@RoyalMail thank you! What about Guernsey?
@RoyalMail And there's no email address. I can't use the phone so at the moment there's no way to get in touch except here.
@RoyalMail Under the 'redelivery' section of your contact bit it shows a live chat symbol but it's not a link

@RoyalMail last few years have had a fair few items (that I know of) not arrive despite great postie.
Nothing expensive just frustrating
@BBCBreaking didn't send it by @RoyalMail then. only signed it yesterday evening and they've already got it.
@RoyalMail yeah I use it a lot at night but never really had problems before until the last few days
@RoyalMail No, of course. But as it is an eBay seller who may be doing this a lot, you might want checks made.
@RoyalMail I sent a card to my mum for Mother's Day last  Wednesday and she still hasn't received the card. How do I go with complaining?
@RoyalMail No, i can't: "Sorry International Recipients cannot claim"
@RoyalMail I don't have the facility, I think you need to follow me so I can DM you the tracking number. It was sent to Dublin.

I notice that we hand delivered the letter triggering #Article50. Of course we did. We couldnt trust @RoyalMail with the letter could we
@RoyalMail yes the item is fine and fortunately i saw it before somebody passing did.
@RoyalMail sorry, RS069097410LV
@RoyalMail If an envelope has a stamp mark c9 10002 does that mean it was sent first or second class? Many thanks

@DriverPotter That makes @RoyalMail liable for all costs of @redbull honouring a late entry, I'd say! #TheyBrokeIt #TheyFixIt
@RoyalMail I got a friend in Oz to call the number and they said it was Paxfall Digital Money.....all sounded dodgy. I suspect a scam!
@RoyalMail yes but that is not the point! The point is that your postman didn't knock and crossed the road to my elderly neighbour instead!
@RoyalMail I've not received any post since mid last week. How can I check if there are any service issues in my area please?
Seriously impressed with @RoyalMail delivering #Brexit letter so quickly - they only sent it last night.
@PostOffice @RoyalMail touch√© Luke. We good.
@RoyalMail done
@RoyalMail it was posted yesterday, there is no envelope as it's a postcard
Hopefully this #Brexit letter is being sent via @RoyalMail so it can get lost

@RoyalMail what's he point of having online chat if your employees don't respond?
so i get a text from @RoyalMail saying they were unable to deliver my parcel whilst I was sat in my living room... have been in all day.
@RoyalMail the mail isn't to go to me, it's being sent back for a refund but it's apparently got lost!
