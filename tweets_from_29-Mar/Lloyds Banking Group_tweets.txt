@AskLloydsBank hi, if I go into branch and pay my credit card, does the money go straight on my account unlike paying it by debit card?
@AskLloydsBank I found some else's debit card on the floor at Embankment tube station. Should I just destroy it, or send it somewhere?
@AskLloydsBank yes it was and a few days ago and normally gets credited after 3.30 the next day
@AskLloydsBank hi can u speed up a transaction pls
@AskLloydsBank just received this and I don't even have a account with you guys https://t.co/TuC6F6SIgc
@AskLloydsBank @LloydsBankBiz when I signed with Lloyds, there was a biz acct mgr. Now, only confused cashiers. Those ppl were worth keeping
@JohnPKidd @TheFCA @Lesley_KP @pakerianr @Ian_Fraser #HBOS heads up  lost 2 yrs records 4 company milked dry by #HBOS #fraud @AskLloydsBank
@AskLloydsBank @LloydsBankBiz someone somewhere needs to hear that firing all the biz managers really affected biz banking customers.
@AskLloydsBank @LloydsBankBiz  I've chased Lloyds enough. Walked into a HSBC today and they were helpful. Met a biz mgr. moving to them.
@AskLloydsBank 
Iok so you are delaying processing refunds . You are covered by the up to 5 day rule. Please advise will it be full 5 days?
@emmak_25 @AskHalifaxBank @AskLloydsBank so bad how they dont realise it.
@AskLloydsBank hi is there a way to communicate an instruction about my debit card in writing?
@emmak_25 @AskHalifaxBank @AskLloydsBank "not aware of issue" apparently. They will be tomorrow believe me!
@emmak_25 @AskHalifaxBank @AskLloydsBank yep. Lots are, hard to believe they wont front up. Lloyds online balances arent updating...
@emmak_25 @AskHalifaxBank these and @AskLloydsBank are fobbing us all off clearly an issue that they are hiding. Pathetic really.
@AskLloydsBank no 😞
@FEOHull @HemingwayBailey @AskLloydsBank @Gosschalks @SmailesGoldie  great night meeting the cream of hulls entrepreneurs...
@AskLloydsBank it is not updating pending transactions from a few days ago. This is an issue. You need to sort it please.
@AskLloydsBank right, your app/online is faulty. I have tested with a payment and it shows on my statement but not on the balance....
@efgbricklayer @AskLloydsBank as in all business are equal but some ( #bailout #banks) are more equal than others

@AskLloydsBank hi how long does a student get to pay back their overdraft once they graduate?
@staceys1010 @AskHalifaxBank They're all part of the same group @AskLloydsBank.. even contactless payment from Friday still not taken either
@AskLloydsBank I have tried to complete your online complaints form three times and it has come up with an error message each time.
@AskLloydsBank no chance.
I am not waiting 5 days look at your other tweets its happening to others! You sort it.
@AskLloydsBank please tell me what error 9300046 means, it is highly infuriating
@AskLloydsBank Is there any way I can change my Student account the a classic account?
Not impressed to hear how @AskLloydsBank have treated my parents today regarding their credit card fraud
@AskLloydsBank @Calvin_1989 Again, back to denying the issue + not investigating what people who regularly receive payments the next day say
@JonnyHellings @KerrySm00863391 @AskLloydsBank im in the same position. Stop telling us there are no issues when they are. Can u pls sort it
@AskLloydsBank @KerrySm00863391 im heaving the same issue
@JonnyHellings @AskLloydsBank 
I just hope they can trace them and catch up but until its accepted as an issue not sure what will happen.
@KerrySm00863391 @AskLloydsBank As well as a one payment sent Monday and yesterday. None of the 4 refunds I've received. It's a joke.
@KerrySm00863391 @AskLloydsBank Yeah, my refund was also sent on Friday..Always comes in at 3.30 the next working day (Monday) but not yet!
@JonnyHellings @AskLloydsBank 
I contacted two of the places i am expecting payments from. They have definitely passed these to lloyds.
@KerrySm00863391 @AskLloydsBank and this will be pending for the THIRD day tomorrow. It's not just refunds, it's de… https://t.co/PEAHmOrqUW
@KerrySm00863391 @AskLloydsBank Third person who has said this.. yet nobody is doing anything. We can't be all lying.
@JonnyHellings @AskLloydsBank 
Yea its an issue. Something is wrong. Please listen and investigate lloyds.
@AskLloydsBank They're not. I have banked with you for 13 years, I know how quick my debits/credits take. It's an issue believe it or not..
@AskLloydsBank You have 2 people telling you it usually happens the next day. I'm telling you the debits also happen a day later and...
@AskLloydsBank I went into branch today and asked to change a note to the new £1 coins... was told they didn't have any?!
@AskLloydsBank i got this message. Is it legit or scam? Why do i need to contact bank if this message is actually f… https://t.co/98umnX3dau
@joewildish @HSBC @AskLloydsBank lipstick on the proverbial pig
@AskLloydsBank online. I have since spoken to you via phone and he explained not an acc issue and could be delay at visas side?
@JonnyHellings @AskLloydsBank yeah there must be a issue somewher e ive had refund back to another bank and they were credited today
@halifaxbroker Also your @AskLloydsBank in Holmfirth don't treat shareholders with respect.
@AskLloydsBank direct debit of £92.00 was not paid today £91.96 was in the account. Disgusted with this bank &amp; way they treat customers.
@AskLloydsBank I used to have a current account with Lloyds but I would like access to old statements online. How do I go about this??
@DEVONDAVE82 @AskLloydsBank Agreed.. this happens for me too. A refund I got on Friday still hasn't hit my account. There's issues for sure!
@AskLloydsBank @DEVONDAVE82 That isn't true. There definitely is issues. My debits haven't left my account since Monday and no credits..

@AskLloydsBank yes it a refund back to my card normally it's credited after 3.30 pm the next day

@AskLloydsBank  any issues with updating account and credit refunds normally I would the refund the day after it was sent but nothing
@AskHalifaxBank (2/2) https://t.co/nkC6zSMBdj @AskLloydsBank
@AskLloydsBank I haven't no! But I've just been told that's what I need to do! I will try that :)
@AskLloydsBank if you fraud team is going to stop my card every time I want to pay my credit card bill, they could at least answer the phone
@AskLloydsBank Thanks &amp; do you have a list of facilities? Cash cheques, deposits etc?
Hi @AskLloydsBank how far in advance does one need to book an appointment for opening a current account? Or can it be done online?

@AskLloydsBank Hi. I have a new credit card and the contactless doesn't seem to work!? Do I need to activate some how!? :)
@AskLloydsBank Thank you, I have already. They told me based on previous experience,  it may take a very long time!!
@AskLloydsBank hi. It's a private/personal account
@HSBC_UK_Help as in, called four times in over a week. Promised calls back to no avail. Shall I go to @AskLloydsBank or @BarclaysUK instead?
Leaving @AskLloydsBank - there is never anyone in a branch who knows anything abt biz banking and the phone lines are too congested. I'm out
@AskLloydsBank No. My wife's family is though. I live in Canada, used your ATM in Brecon, no money came out and I was still charged!
@AskLloydsBank if I see a suspicious payment on my account ... do I have to call or can I live chat to someone
@AskLloydsBank your voice recognition systems don't work.
Props to @AskLloydsBank for the surprise moving in gift.. 😍 Nice touch that! 🏠👌🏽 https://t.co/vei2kcjPHJ
