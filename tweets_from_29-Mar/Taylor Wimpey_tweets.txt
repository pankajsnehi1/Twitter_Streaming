@TaylorWimpey when are you surfacing our roads...everytime it rains it floods! please can you look into this thnx https://t.co/LR3G16TMlE
@helenfryer83 @TaylorWimpey live in one of their homes. Our independent advisors said theyd never ever seen workmanship like it
@helenfryer83 @TaylorWimpey I didn't know this Helen but no surprise. Absolutely shocking company to deal with when unfortunate enough to...
@lanajayne20 @TaylorWimpey it should be unbelievable but the more I read and experience the more believable it is
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey exactly that! Pay for a new home and expect a few snagging issues but that's it. Not major problems.
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey When you've already paid over the odds for a new home, you don't expect to pay extra to get it up to scratch!
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey Yes, we've paid for our own structural engineer to visit over various issues that TW have simply ignored
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey that would have helped! I just wanted an admission after got independent advice and sorting the problem
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey no. Bovis Homes have been charged with issues &amp; im talking to journos involved in covering that
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey House builders seem to be Teflon-coated. All we've wanted was an apology &amp; someone to speak to us courteously
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey I've been reading articles this morning though and it seems despite all the horror stories nothing improves.
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey release produced to send to all local papers where there is a development going up.
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey I'm doing the same. I have spoken with journalists who have covered similar stories and am getting press
@Caroline_Stocks @TaylorWimpey dealt with local team and no resolution. They laid floorboards wet causing damage &amp;‚Ä¶ https://t.co/sEmQBMoxLd
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey so I think it'll be entirely useless. Next step is legal action.
@afootballscout Have you tried @TaylorWimpey head office? My latest complaint to them has been handed back to the useless regional team...
@afootballscout We've had a catalogue of problems with have been compounded by appalling @TaylorWimpey customer service...
@gaz1979hughes @TaylorWimpey yet more examples of disgusting work from TW. Have you had any success in getting it sorted?

@dannyjebb1 @TaylorWimpey they don't care despite it being poor workmanship and @NHBC aren't worth a dime. Good luck with your search
@dannyjebb1 @TaylorWimpey that's part of it!I bought a 30mth old property. The problems are unbelievable on a "new" house.Once outside 2yrs
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey üëçüèª done some research into the whole leasehold scandal and we've started looking at older houses üòÉ
@dannyjebb1 @TaylorWimpey TW
@DavidStockdale1 @TaylorWimpey TW or NHBC will act. I'm in process of warning others and producing work highlighting the faults/issues
@afootballscout @TaylorWimpey  you talking about the area or TW?
@DavidStockdale1 @TaylorWimpey david, good luck! I've had independent ppl look at poor work in my house say terrible workmanship yet neither
@dannyjebb1 @TaylorWimpey hi Danny, from someone in Manchester do yourself a favour and look elsewhere
@morphy86 @TaylorWimpey they'll wait until past 2yrs and then do nothing! TW customer care &amp; @NHBC aren't worth a thing.
@MyHouseSucks taylor Wimpey (@TaylorWimpey) and @NHBC are a disgrace. Poor workmanship&amp;no after care despite major faults. Never buy 1 again
@TaylorWimpey there are many raised manholes which makes it v tricky to drive past/over and no one from TW is communicating a finish date
@TaylorWimpey hi yes they are still the same. I'm passing on the message a group of residents have put on Facebook . Thanks
@TaylorWimpey you've got lots hacked off residents at your romans site in Sp11. Prep work for tarmac has just been left &amp; we've had no comms
