@matthewnunn1986 @SkyUK I'm enjoying it but I miss being able to set reminders. Anyway, I'm quickly becoming used to the new user interface.
Is it coincidence that my @SkyUK box miraculously works perfectly the moment I cancel my subscription &amp; tell them their offer is too late? 🤔
@RachaelCS @SkyUK @virginmedia would have been out tonight through Straker #snoozeyoulose 😂
@SkyUK gives the worst internet service I've ever had to put up with. I can't even move to Virgin because it's not in the area I live 😡😡

@nadiasawalha @SkyUK is it flu nadia you looked quite pale last night on the live .oh hang on it was the yorkdhire that looked pale not you😅
@virginmedia probably worth cancelling the contract on the grounds I am not getting the service I pay for. Hopefully back to @SkyUK soon
@virginmedia how do I get a refund and where do I complain for the dire service. I'm off to @SkyUK please @SkyUK call me up about switching
Is anyone else's @SkyUK #broadband on a go slow? 3 days and it continues to buffer y do I pay extra for fibre optic again? #slower

@SkyUK and its been like that all day. Im paying nearly £100 and the broadband is atrocious. And please dont tell me to switch off and on.
@virginmedia is not as good as @SkyUK and I regret switching. Don't make the same mistake. That is all.
@SkyUK Sick and tired of your internet service and logging in on my 4g phone to see green lights. Modem is flashing orange on the internet
Cannot believe how useless that call with @virginmedia was, all being well off to @SkyUK I go 🙋🏽🙋🏽
@SkyUK How can I speak to someone? I called the helpline number and got an automated message
@emma_coppen @SkyUK I hope @geo_anderson_ knows about this infidelity
My @SkyUK broadband is so bad, I can't even stream a 720 YouTube video.
No landline phone for over a week with no update from @SkyUK any chance of a call back as promised?

@SkyUK #shocking service, can't believe you renew automatically without informing customers + increase the price by 1/3 with no reminders!
So disappointed with the service received from @SkyUK loyalty obviously means nothing to this company....
Can anyone help why is episode 14 of season 12 @CrimMinds_CBS not being shown in #uk @SkyUK why the jump from 13-15??? 🤔
@virginmedia no. I think it would be much less hassle to move to @SkyUK

@merseamillsy @FOXTV @SkyUK Yes both great, but struggling a bit with Legion at the moment.
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK is there any news on when SkyGo can be used on firefox or chrome again? it's been months
@SkyUK am I being fobbed off, I have to give 30 days notice to cancel my subscription?
Watched so many @SkyCinemaUK on demand, now checking out @SkyUK Boxsets. Getting my monies worth 😊
Binge watching Season 1 of Outcast &amp; Legion at the moment.  Really enjoying both shows &amp; would highly recommend @FOXTV @SkyUK
@SkyUK @bt_uk  my @virginmedia contract is up, what can you do for me?
Just cancelled @SkyUK TV after 14 yr due to price, called up for discount but offered Sky Q for £199 &amp; £20 discount, not really a saving!

@SkyUK still waiting for a call back I was told 10-15 minute that was 2 hours ago why is it so hard to call people back
@SkyUK These are fibre speeds?! Slower than 55% of GB. What sort of game are you playing Sky? https://t.co/DF9qqrDteW
@ohsorosie @SkyUK well they've still not done mine considering I ordered 2 weeks before I moved...and it was sky here before!
@virginmedia letting me down again, Internet down 2nd time in 2 weeks. More issues in 1 month of Virgin than several years with @SkyUK
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK had broken internet for 6 week and sky are useless mongs who cant fix it! Worst provider in UK by a mile

@Ceri221 @SkyUK even someone shit like @TalkTalkGroup would say sorry! Shame on you sky
@Pete_E83 @SkyUK and not even the gall to tweet me an apology, would have got one off any other provider 🙈
@Ceri221 @SkyUK bit of a joke really ain't it sky?? Messing with people like this is crap service!! #poorcustomerservice

Well @SkyUK have lost a long term customer today due to the shocking discount they offered me to stay, disappointing 😒 @SkyHelpTeam
@SkyUK @BTGroup your C.E.O Gavin Paterson couldn't help so I wouldn't expect @BTCare to be of any help. !!!!!
@SkyUK We are experiencing slow/loss of signal with our broadband, can you advise of any issues in the S61 area?

Watch the first play-off V @flamesicehockey in @icing_tonight on @madeinbhamtv tonight at 7pm - @SkyUK 117,… https://t.co/NwtJY9xRmY
I made the mistake of leaving @SkyUK to switch to @BTGroup for my broadband. Could not deliver what was promised an left with no broadband
So, @Plusnet @bt_uk @SkyUK who wants my business? @virginmedia has failed for me most days since install 19 days ago. Service is a joke.
@SqueezeJuice @SkyUK omg u are so right....the main reason I left them and went to virgin
Blown away by horrendous customer service from @SkyUK this morning.  If it wasn't so terrible it might be laughable
Hey @lucyallan @telfordutd @telfordlive @_andy_phillips @madeinbhamtv @SkyUK how about a retweet for our final home… https://t.co/Q3OQFezdlS
@SkyUK seriously since we have had SkyQ and fibre we have never had so many dropouts ! What do I pay the extra for ?!? Ugh

@SkyUK @KayBurley we're not bothered how a Dutch lady feels about Brexit, she can always go home. Our own people come first now.
@DisneyXDUK help seems @SkyUK  didn't record at the weekend the last 2 episodes of #rebels are they showing again ?
@SkyUK still waiting for a reply
@SkyUK presenter too thick to realise the @FT is cooking the books. Angry remainers #cheers
For the second time, can @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam someone please get in touch with me to rectify the poor scenario I am in
@BazCummings @SkyUK 2/2 and they can raise this to Openreach on your behalf Barrie ^Chris
@BazCummings @SkyUK You would need to report a fault with your broadband provider 1/2
@SkyUK just 2 let everyone know if u receive a voucher code from sky 4 a free film they will debut ur account &amp;  ignore u when u complain
@SkyUK seeing as you have stolen money from my account &amp; cut us off live chat the second we mention it I'm reporting you for fraud
@SkyUK so your now charging a connection fee to phone you? Does everyone know sky also charge 9.8p a minute for their HELPLINE!!
@SkyUK absolute joke send us a code 4 a free film then debit our account! on live chat and get cut off 7 times!! You r a joke time 2 leave
Just had the combi boiler serviced. Turns out @SkyUK mounted their dish covering the boiler outlet. That needs moving.
@SkyLivingHD @SkyUK why aren't you showing E14 of criminal minds and skipping to 15. It was a 2 parter effectively? #CriminalMinds
@SkyHelpTeam Been able to see S1-S12of Greys Anatomy on sky boxsets,but why are there random episodes of S13? @SkyUK no point of the boxsets
Three phone calls and assurances my bill will be correct by last Friday and it's not done, you taking the piss @SkyUK  ???
@SkyUK Help! Sky Go stopped working for me this morning with error, "Content currently unavailable. Please try again later" (error code 21)
@BTGroup waited 3 months for installation + connection, countless calls to arrogant customer service. Went to @SkyUK installed in 2 weeks
@lxd1 @SkyUK from my experience it won't get better. Been waiting 2 weeks for a reply to a complaint. #BelieveInBetter by going elsewhere.
@SkyUK @bt_uk it's been happening in the past while bt work has been going on
@SkyUK my Internet broadband doesn't work since @bt_uk  were working on my street  yesterday on peregrine crescent droylsden
@Louis_Akindele Becomes unwatchable when @SkyUK and @bt_uk commentary teams make a complete hash of their coverage - primitive, uninformed.
@SkyUK naa I've spoke to customer service this morning and they could not resolve my complaint so your going to so I'm calling ofcom
@SkyUK why would you advertise SkyQ and Sky Multiscreen to me via mail, email, app and then when I try to sign up for it is not available?
@MattNavarra even big brands are getting in on the sweet super engagement game aint that right @SkyUK  #whatToS? https://t.co/bKbXS61E4a
Finished #bingewatching Lost, now I'm at a loss (ha funny!) as to what to watch now. Any suggestions...! @SkyUK @NetflixUK
