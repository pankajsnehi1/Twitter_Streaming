@IHG is an insensitive company. We asked to cancel a reservation a month ahead due to a deceased family friend and they refused to refund me
@haveanicesummer @IHG Hi Justin, I'm sorry to hear that. I've asked @IHGService to come back to you to discuss this.

@IHG @AngelaBrav Any advice? I used to enjoy staying at IHG hotels but for some strange reason... I'm feeling less loyal today

@IHG hey I'm having a problem with my sign up points, and the regular customer service line isn't being too helpful! maybe you can help
@IHG SUCKS Checked all archived email and none found @HolidayInn SUCKS
Willingly gave back 40000 points because they needed them more SUCKS

@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub care about my continued loyalty and are fighting to not reward me the points I deserve, is ridiculous
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub you do not care about your loyal customers, I have many choices for hotels, and the fact that you do not

@IHG @ihgrewardsclub I just had the worst experience imaginable for a points reinstatement. I never received any emails regarding expiration
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub but you know, the fine print can't be helped!
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub ironically I stayed at four+ IHG hotels in the past year but booked through 3rd parties so didn't count
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub Relax, it's #HolidayInn. But don't miss the point renewal deadline by four days or GTFO!
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub not the most "on brand" move to screw young professionals out of their money because of "fine print"
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub Not the sort of thing I'd like aired publicly, were I in charge of IHG P.R. or Social Networking
@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub Probably the sort of thing I'd be calling the head of Rewards about. Were I an IHG executive.
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub Your hotels were my #1 choice previously. Now I'm bothering you on Twitter. Worth it?
.@IHGService @IHG @ihgrewardsclub what's your customer acquisition cost anyways? Higher than the marginal cost of returning 120k points?
.@IHGService @ihg @ihgrewardsclub Dear Executive, Your rewards program is alienating previously happy customers. Maybe have a meeting.
@IHG You're like an object lesson in corporate shortsightedness by not making a tiny exception to keep a customer happy
@IHG calling and dealing with your customer service who didn't seem to even care about losing business over a LOYALTY program was surreal
@IHG I've stayed hundreds of times, never will again nor will my company. All so you can take around $600 in points from me? Loyalty indeed
@IHG so your loyalty program just lead to me never being a customer again by "expiring" my points. Missed the deadline by four days...

@IHGService @IHG it's like you really don't want loyal guests
@IHGService @IHG you would think that someone who spends 70+ nights a year at your hotels wouldn't have to do this everytime
@IHGService this is terribly disappointing that every time I have to call to get points from my @IHG stays
