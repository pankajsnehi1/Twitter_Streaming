@DirectLine_UK absolutely disgusting! I hope a lot of people see this and think twice about where they take their home insurance!
@DirectLine_UK OUR FAULT for not calling him back? £350 excess, your fault we have a hole in the ceiling, and you imply we're to blame?
@DirectLine_UK didn't do his job properly and left water running which he was meant to switch off. Our ceiling comes through and it's
@DirectLine_UK why take this offline? You sent an incompetent plumber out, who took a personal call on an emergency call out, got distracted
Rubbish @directline_uk - can't get a quote online. On phone just say 'we can't give you a quote'. No reason. 23 years perfect driving record
