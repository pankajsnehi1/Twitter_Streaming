@Jai575 @BTGroup get in touch with the chief exec #gavinpatterson @BBCWatchdog or dial the 101 non emergency service get it towed away
@bt_uk @BTGroup @BTCare @btsport no wonder this company is being fined millions! Nobody has a clue what they are doing! &amp; advisers hang up
Very alarming! You cannot speak to anyone who knows what they are doing &amp; no one willing to help @bt_uk @BTGroup @BTCare @btsport
@scalyonee1977 @BTGroup I believe you. Never known worse customer service. One of their vans, blocking my drive today since 10am. Twats
@BTCare I got the phone. No happy ending with equipment left in bin. I got sent two routers and @BTGroup can't deliver on connection
Can't believe the appalling service @btgroup head office are giving customers &amp; non customers! Very standoffish! Shunted on hold no warning!

@BTCare @bt_uk @BTGroup I don't get it why don't you support wifi on TFL? Why isn't there login for BT customers when they need to use wifi?

@BITCIreland @BTGroup  Great to hear Shay Walsh MD talk about employee volunteering and that staff satisfaction is high.#businessmatters
@BTGroup how about fibre enabling the cabinet at the end of my road? All the interconnecting roads have it. #notfinanciallyviable
I made the mistake of leaving @SkyUK to switch to @BTGroup for my broadband. Could not deliver what was promised an left with no broadband
