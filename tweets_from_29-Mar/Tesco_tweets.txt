So desperate am I for a council house cappuccino, I slummed it at @Tesco #Express. Instead of buying 4 pints @ ¬£1, I bought 4 x 1 pint @ 24p
@ricke17 @Tesco Amazing, thanks Ricardo, we hope that you will continue to enjoy shopping with us.

@Tesco Hi, no it's the Tesco Express on St Christopher Road. Thanks.
@Tesco overcharged on creme egg mugs which should be ¬£3 for ¬£10!
I purchased 9 which should have been ¬£30 but charged ¬£36!
@Tesco done. Not that I'll bother using this service again. Happened one too many times now

@SteveLove7 @Tesco @DeesideDotCom thanks so much it looks fab! #community #workingtogether
@Tesco I don't think it is good customer service to have this approach in a large store!
@Tesco Why don‚Äôt I receive coupons anymore for online shops via club card? Always used to be available at online checkout...
@WooldenHill @Discoverytrust @Tesco how can we get tickets?
@Chris_Locksmith #Tesco seem to have swapped value lemonade recipes with @LidlUK too. The new one is flat and tasteless. Sort it out @Tesco

@Tesco thanks for coming back to me. Did think the store was very understaffed when I was there. But can't help but feel that's by design üòû
@Tesco ..Please feel free to pass it on to your suppliers - maybe they'll use it to produce a better version :) Have a fab day, Jayne!
@Tesco Awwww, bless you! That's lovely of you, but there's really no need - I was just messing around :) But the feedback is valid so..
