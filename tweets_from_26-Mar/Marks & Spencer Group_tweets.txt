@marksandspencer my wife is #vegetarian heading towards #vegan, I'm not far behind. #m&amp;sfoods vegan choices are lacking. Please sort it out😬
@marksandspencer extremely disappointed   Ordered flowers for Mother's Day gift and requested delivery yesterday. They've still not arrived

@marksandspencer the icing on my teapot tasted really perfumey 😞 such a shame! #MothersDay https://t.co/BUZlLEeUkX
@__ClaireMac @marksandspencer It will be mine 😍
@thelovecatsinc @marksandspencer It's an even more perfect shade of pink in real life 👌🏼
@marksandspencer thanks! &amp; if u could change the packaging 2 say rocket not just lettuce I would be greatful as it would save any confusion!
@iliketweet @marksandspencer It is pretty amazing 😍
@marksandspencer Is it normal that your stores close at 15 mins before closing time? Hackney had security (rudely) stopping entry at 4.45pm
@andrew_w_almond @marksandspencer that's why you should use a real florist! Big companies can't hack it, hire couriers, faff it up!
@marksandspencer   nearly side swiped today by your lorry, J11 M1 at 2pm. My 5 month old baby was in the car at the time. PN15 HXZ.
@iliketweet @marksandspencer oh my sweet Jesus I need it
@marksandspencer just did. Complete joke - spent over an hour on chat to customer service/yodel. I don't want them now - occasion missed!
@Estellosaurus @marksandspencer mine the same and nobody responded to my tweet or call!

Thanks @marksandspencer for not delivering the flowers for my mum today. Awaiting despatch since yesterday morning apparently.
@marksandspencer completely wrong flowers sent to my Mum today and no chocolates, really disappointed as ordered last month.
@OC @marksandspencer Thanks so much for the top tip. It's SO good. That and #LineofDuty just made my Sunday!
My poor gran left with no flowers on Mothers Day despite being ordered weeks ago! Not what I expect from @marksandspencer 😡
@rainybels @marksandspencer Oh. 😔
@Siobhan_Connell @marksandspencer 😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷
@marksandspencer very disappointed 2 flower orders in March not delivered on day requested and tracking useless, will buy local in future !!
@marksandspencer so I ordered flowers to be delivered today for my mom and they didn't arrive today 😑 #nothappy 💐❌

@rainybels @marksandspencer I would hope so. Bit late for Mother's day now though. 😔
@picturofBritain @marksandspencer I'm in the same boat. I'm very disappointed, especially as I chose M&amp;S as they are a brand I trust.
@marksandspencer #MothersDay
@salstars @marksandspencer Will investigate!
@UXMuch @marksandspencer Same with me. Extremely disappointed. Hopefully we can get a refund.
Flowers not delivered on Saturday by @marksandspencer. Promised today. Still not delivered. A very upset mother.  Must do better.
@marksandspencer You might want to consider employing more staff to answer phones on one of your busiest days of the years for flowers.
@debrabrown_ Ugh. How annoying. Fingers crossed @marksandspencer will sort this out for you asap.
@marksandspencer After 50 plus minutes waiting for someone to answer your helpline I've been told it's now coming tomorrow. A day late.
@marksandspencer Your feedback/complaint email contact forms produce a "something went wrong" message when you submit them. V frustrating.

@marksandspencer Being delivered tomorrow due to a "delayed driver", but I'm in Wales &amp; both parents are at work all week. Typical!
@marksandspencer Luckily my Mom had other gifts from me, but flowers were the main one..
@marksandspencer Ordered the 100 tulip and daffodil bouquet for my mum. What turned up was a disgrace! Delivered upside down and half dead!
Thanks @marksandspencer for not delivering flowers to my Mum on mothers day. Hard living away, you just made it harder

Thank you to the wonderful Izzy who just served me in @marksandspencer  Newport (Spytty) You brightened up my Mother's Day ☺
@marksandspencer with all the alleged chaos for Mothers Day flower deliveries, please tell me now if my order for 2morrow will be cocked up
.@marksandspencer promised to call me back, and didn't. Then just emailed me a £10 voucher with no apology. Very poor customer service.
So I got some amazing bits from @BootsUK, &amp; hoping to hear soon from @CostaCoffee &amp; @marksandspencer to support me running the VLM for Mind!
Grrr... @marksandspencer and @DPD_UK what a cock up on my Mother's Day flowers delivery.

@marksandspencer Mother's Day flowers failed to arrive on Friday. Didn't come yesterday. And no-one answering helpline. Any suggestions?

Lovely staff @marksandspencer in Harrow yesterday both serving on the self service tills.
@marksandspencer What's happened to your socks? Used to last for years and now holes in several pairs within a few weeks.
M&amp;S holding onto my &gt;£1,000 for weeks. I bet you wouldn't let your customers get away without paying you? Sort it out @marksandspencer
Thank you @marksandspencer - my mother is delighted with her flowers. #MothersDay https://t.co/O0DKMQuTHE

Really poor service from @marksandspencer . Mums present not delivered on Thursday. Was apparently damaged but no one told me #MothersDay
@marksandspencer Emailing at 03:20 to say you won't deliver flowers to my mother today? 30min wait for cust servs? Unacceptable #MothersDay
@kazziejane @marksandspencer Poor service! Would expect better from such a reputable company. Fuming!

Desperately disappointed @marksandspencer - email today saying #MothersDay flowers may be delayed up to 24hrs. No good 2mrw!
@marksandspencer trying to reach M&amp;S on live chat no response - bouquet marked 'delivered' on Fri never arrived, no card left?
@runaulait @marksandspencer oh dear
@marksandspencer went with you for quality but would have been better if going to Tesco and getting some finest flowers. So dissatisfied
@Magicwand78 @Tesco @marksandspencer 😯
@santababy100 @marksandspencer texted me to say tomorrow. Rather have my money back and try the local garage. Useless.
@runaulait @marksandspencer still time? No?
I could make a better teapot than that! 😂 @marksandspencer https://t.co/yUlnaciEA9
@marksandspencer make matters worse I be been on hold for 15 mins
@marksandspencer cheers for the disappointing Mother's Day flowers you sent my mum, clearly been dropped and look limp #nothappy 😠
@marksandspencer I ordered flowers for delivery today but cannot find a confirmation from you- how can I track if they have been delivered?
@StopFundingHate @marksandspencer biggest clothing sales fall in 10 years. You should change where you advertise, it's not working is it? 😉

@marksandspencer and I received a 'dispatch email' that they'll be with me shortly 9 hours AFTER they've been delivered #backwards #service
Is annoyed @marksandspencer, I order flowers to be delivered on Mother's Day so I don't understand why they've been delivered a day early!!!
