@paddypower @paulodalsasso
@paddypower @josacklund I've split a rib laughing at that, the originality is so superbly done it should go down in the annals of twatters
@paddypower paddy, Scotland scored in the 88th min and ruined my acca, can you pay out anyway? Cheers x
@OnlyDegsandGees @BetfairCS sports book is horrendous for it ! I blame @paddypower fingering the pie

@paddypower 99.9% of EPL club fans,will take a boring win every single time.
@JamesMonty1996 @paddypower we get an easy group because we earn the right by winning most of the time. We've lost 4 in 51 competitive games
@paddypower no customer appreciation what do ever. Will be closing my account straight after the match.
@paddypower bet on Griffiths to score 1st at half time. One min later he is off injured &amp; you don't even refund it... How cheap can you be?
@JamesMonty1996 @paddypower a freak result, it happens in football. Of the teams you mention only Wales had a better Euros - where they now?
@paddypower what price on scott brown to get booked?
@NobbyDancing @paddypower look at the Euros Ireland, Wales and Northern Ireland all had better tournaments and Iceland beat England
@SkyBet @Ladbrokes @paddypower Any odds on Pompey not to get promoted this season? #RealisticPompeyFan 😂🙈
@NobbyDancing @paddypower every competition England get an easy group then struggle as soon as the meet a big team yet rate themselves high
