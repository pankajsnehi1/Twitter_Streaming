@Becky_V @RoyalMail I'd love to hear what the post office have to say?
@1Adhughes @RoyalMail yes but besides the point - they have a separate car park for them behind the customer one!
@Becky_V @RoyalMail just block the vans in, the obviously don't need to use them.
@RoyalMail my tracked 24 delivery due yesterday hasn't arrived, on tracked says it's delivered to house or neighbour, but no delivery card

Due to @RoyalMail failing to deliver.  I'm forfeiting my Mother's Day to deliver to a customer in Leicester That's 6hrs away from my kids üò°

@RoyalMail ordered an item from usa, knew about customs charge, but you  decide to add on a further ¬£8, how does this breakdown? seems high?
@RoyalMail I'm very disappointed with your service I sent a Mother's Day card 1st class on Wednesday 22nd march and it hasn't been received
@RoyalMail Is it not ridiculous that when you get through to a human about lost mail, they refer you to your email system for help?! #FFS
@RoyalMail Strikes again! Post a card 1st class 4pm Thurs, measure, weigh, post in the post office. 3 days later, hasn't arrived! Useless!!!
@RoyalMail https://t.co/D8IirlwjnG
@RoyalMail mail was supposed to come yesterday but is now marked as retention. No card was left, how am I meant to collect it from the DO?
@RoyalMail took my parcel back to the sorting office and have now lost my @VapemateUK order! no call back or anything for 3 daysüò°üò°i need it!
