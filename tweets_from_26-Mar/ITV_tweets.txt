@ITV @IAmJermainDefoe nice one
@ITV why the fuck do you still give hoddle a job he makes a shit game even shitter there must be more candidates for the job #ENGvLIT
The last time @IAmJermainDefoe scored at Wembley the provider was one @jackwhitehall...(this from @itv commentators so could be #fakenews)
@ITV I wonder how many times Sterling and Alli will fall and roll in pain????????. Would never last in the Wales or Irish team.
