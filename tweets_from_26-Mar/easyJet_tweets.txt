Dear @easyJet Is a parachute permissible as hand luggage?
@ThisIsJoFrank @easyJet ha! Same 3 hrs - landed *after* I was even suppose to be in bed! Same excuse as last time: air con üôÑ
@easyJet I just worked it out. And because of your service, it would almost have been quicker to drive back from Aberdeen to London.
@ChrisCav75 @SkyNews @easyJet That's not how it works I'm afraid
@easyJet and now you can't even get stairs ready for when we land. Thanks for a thoroughly shit journey!
More great service from @easyJet.  Flight delayed again, ground crew a no-show on landing. Now missed last train home. Hooray! (Not hooray)
@easyJet we've been waiting almost an hour for the luggage at Luton airport. What an efficient service you're providing üò±
@easyJet missed flight so didn't fly - can I get a refund on return flight?
Absolute shambles @easyJet @LDNLutonAirport. Landed over an hour ago and still no bags. None of your staff seem willing or able to explain?!
@LDNLutonAirport @easyJet 55 minutes to get our "hand" luggage from the hold &amp; we're still waiting!!! #slowluggage #gladwewereearly #EZY2268
My #London weekend was amazing. Until my @easyJet flight home was late. I missed a bus, had to wait for an hour. Missed #LineofDuty too!
Is there an issue @easyjet? I can't check in via the app or webpage for a flight this week. How much is this gonna cost me at the airport?
@easyJet @MenziesAviation where is our luggage. Landed 45mins ago off ezy020 edin to luton?
@easyJet @LDNLutonAirport getting annoyed now where the hell is our bag. We only checked it in as easyJet had to little room. Work tomorrow

@easyJet do I have to print my boarding pass or can I show it on my phone?
Can't believe my colleague is getting NO #refund (expenses) or #compensation @easyJet for a 21 hour #flight #delay from Italy in 1/17 WTF? üò°
Nearly 3 hour delay on @easyjet ezy608 yet the flight that was scheduled after ours is going to fly on time. Where is the logic there?
@easyJet she doesn't do Twitter.
looks like I wont be booking my weekend away to scotland #pablosbirthdaypubgolf @easyJet https://t.co/sTv9tcl9v9
@easyJet you've now just cancelled the flight! Will we ever get home?
hello @easyJet , what is the allowed baggage weight(check in)for EZY 8322 flight?
@easyJet Thank you.  Will use that link.
#disappointed with @easyJet. Left #Rome at the time I was suppose to land in #London !! Then waited #45mins for stairs!! #MothersDay #Lol

@easyJet arreciffe gatwick vueling flight appalling service - not what I booked
@easyJet why have you just flown me home on a vueling flight - if I wanted dreadful service I would have booked them . Annoyed .
@easyJet vous trouvez √ßa normal de vendre plus de billets qu'il n'y a de places disponibles sur un vol ?? #honn√™tet√© #transparence
@easyJet hi please read my dm!! Thanks
@easyJet also making me 30 minutes later than my severely autistic daughter was expecting üò°üò°üò°
@easyJet furious that our baggage has been put in the hold not WITH us on board.The whole point of takin HAND luggage is to keep it with us!
Hi @easyJet! Doing a charity jailbreak from uni tomorrow, need to get as far as possible, looking for cheap flights from UK! Can you help?
@easyJet I saw you cheeky sods! That's why I said "talk about squeezing us"
@easyJet Thanks, I know what the policy is. I'll DM you.
Absolute chaos at Milan Malpensa airport with @easyJet. Three hour delay to London Gatwick and still no idea what's going on!!!
@easyJet  why do you always seat me next to a crying child?? Do you hate me!!
@easyJet flight delayed 2.45hrs. Member of EasyjetFlightClub &amp; flight cant be changed??? Can you help? #tired
@Ryanair @easyJet **name change
@Ryanair just out of curiosity, how come @easyJet manage to do a simple name for a lot less?! https://t.co/61LhK8AjuG
@easyJet hi please read my DM, thanks!
@easyJet Thanks Paulo, all sorted!
Traumatic experience with @taportugal yesterday n such kind n humane experience with @easyJet today. @taportugal learn from @easyJet
@easyJet this link is no use, it keeps sending me in circles. Please test this UX. I need someone to call me please.
@easyJet delaying me for 2 hours then keeping me on the plane for 30 minutes, you paying extra hours on my parking yes? Stupid orange turds
Again, my flight is going to be delayed @easyJet, I appreciate that thank you üòÉ
@easyJet - Bonikai - your staff at Gatwick airport right now is a gem! We need nore people like her. Super helpful and so human. Thank you!
@easyJet I would rather pay double the price than ever fly with Easy Jet again. Pathetic customer service!
@Gatwick_Airport @easyJet please can you tell me if I can bring a toddler sippy cup (over 100 ml) in hand luggage? Many thanks!
Inbound from Faro @NCLairport @iLove_Aviation @iLove_Aviation @AviateAddict @easyJet https://t.co/MHLBD1Cwb8
No volver a viajar con @easyjet es el mejor consejo que os puedo dar en la vida
@Ryanair long standing customer just booked my flights with @easyJet after the issues @Ryanair caused this morning
@easyJet why only accept pounds or euros on a flight from a country that uses neither? #thirsty #hadneither EZY7254
@easyJet le vol retour ne fut guerre mieux. Bloqu√©s 2h ds l'avion, un verre d'eau offert. #CustomerExperience

DO NOT TRAVEL @easyJet from Gatwick. No human beings to check in bags. #terrorism opportunity. Inefficient, incomprehensible and DANGEROUS
@jambojamtart Sorry to hear about the delayed departure, we'll feed this back to @easyJet and the handling agent. Thanks, JH
@easyJet travelling Friday with u,do you know if the toiletries you put in your hand luggage.Do they have2be in individual see through bags?
@easyJet Hi. My Mum and Dad are flying from Glasgow to Stansted before going 2 Moscow. They've  to pay to "check in" apparently. Surely not?
@easyJet not how planned to spend #mothersday stuck in Faro Airport 5 hr delay. Thanks for the voucher - not enough to buy sandwich #shoddy
@easyJet thanks for a great #MothersDay stuck @ #Gatwick #NoPlane üòê
@easyJet very dangerous bags being checked in by machines no humans. Loads of mistakes. Huge opportunity for terrorists. MORE HUMANS PLEASE!

2/2 but do they actually think ppl with a baby going to hospital has time 2 pay for doctors letters? Bloody joke! Be avoiding @easyJet now.
1/2 @easyJet just told me 2 send a letter 2 prove lachlan is ill &amp; that's why we can't fly or we'll not get a refund. I didn't expect one
@easyJet Regarding your complaint reference ID: 115403016;  you lost in court, why do you not pay up?  Do I have to get bailiffs?
@easyJet also not sure about email. No original flight details. Wording different. Sent from a donotreply address? Help!
@easyJet why can't I check into my flight that is in 3 hours? https://t.co/ERvVYmr3DF
@easyJet day 16, still not a single call back about my complaint although promised! How can I escalate this?

@easyJet got my lock stolen off my checked in luggage! Absolute joke
No not cool @easyJet. Twice in one weekend? üò°üò°üò° https://t.co/aGbXc0unjZ
@easyJet a response to my Dm would be greatly appreciated!! ‚úåÔ∏è
hey @easyJet the @Jeep advert you put on my boading pass is so huge my old printer chokes on it. Could pls make the optional or slimmer?
@easyJet I don't have a printer and flying tonight - is my boarding pass ok as PDF on my phone? Thanks.
@easyJet Hi, can you confirm time of flight EZY8933 to Paphos on 4 April? Had email changing to 7.10am but boarding pass still says 7.35?
@British_Airways seem to have less leg room than @easyJet now. At least they've given me plenty to read! https://t.co/7HzAUfFyZ7
@easyJet Who do I complain to about poor service during a weather diversion/delay?
https://t.co/JcBibfHGpJ . I can see the @DailyMailUK : a photo of me looking gutted wearing a JJB tracksuit holding up my @Easyjet ticket.
.....and home. Just long enough to plan our next trip :) @easyJet #Italy #wherenext ? https://t.co/oQhCxodrg2
@easyJet we're on the Belfast to London flight at 14.40 but it's saying online checkin not available atm - what should we do?
Wrong way of writing CO2. I hope that @easyJet is not multiplying CO   ;-))
@easyJet_press https://t.co/y6t6hZqxmN
@easyJet why sell a flight that has 25min turn around for the plane scheduled? Clearly impossible even if it isn't delayed first (EZY8918)
5 hour delay on @easyJet coming back from Faro...üò± #notwinning https://t.co/BwtJQBvhK5
Stuck at Geneva - flight 2+ hours delayed @easyJet - please update us (ezy8465)

Cheers @easyJet good to know my flight is so delayed I will be missing #MothersDay dinner #delayed https://t.co/Af0QaOJ1IU
@ExpediaUK no your call centre was of no help, their proposed solution was for me to create a second @EasyJet account for myself
NEVER book an @easyJet flight through @ExpediaUK - always book directly with @easyJet - absolute nightmare @ExpediaUK such poor service

@easyJet thanks for the very informative, timely and helpful response üòê who do I write to, to complain about your woeful customer service?
Due to Berlin airports strike last week, didn't make it to Berlin to catch flight to Amsterdam. Any credit/compensation? @easyJet
@easyJet basically we had to queue for over an hour and a half to check in our bags for our flight to Belfast! Very poorly organised
@RobTrenale @easyJet your point?
