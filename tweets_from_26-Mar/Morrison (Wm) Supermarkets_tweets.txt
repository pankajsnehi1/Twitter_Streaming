shame that @Morrisons has called it a night as phoneline closed. I could have done that if I wasn't waiting for a del that never arrived.
@Morrisons Thought ¬£1 delivery slots were too good to be true. Maybe I need to pay more if I actually want my shopping to turn up!
@Morrisons abducted by aliens perhaps? I presume I am to guess reasons why my shopping never appeared this eve with no contact whatsoever?
@Morrisons Up in 5 hours 4 work but wasted 90mins waiting for delivery that never arrived. No contact at all to let me know. Thanks a lot!
@Morrisons told delivery would be half hour late, stayed up till midnight now app says not being delivered. no explanation.Shocking service.
