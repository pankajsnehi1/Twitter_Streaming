@SkyUK your broadband is a pile of shit. Fucking useless.
Dad just filled in @SkyUK leavers questionnaire and even though he won't be returning he hopes his feedback helps others.
Worst marketing tactic I've had in a while! Literally made me jump up when I read that subject line @SkyUK… https://t.co/5jHT2NxIHS
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam money back please???? What a JOKE. https://t.co/wr90VaNw69
Disappointed @SkyUK felt it was ok 2 send me email wiv subject "They're ready to prosecute" &amp; its an ad for a series! "Poor judgement" i say
gone through 7gb of data in 13 days bcos @SkyUK 's wifi doesnt work in my room, sort it out please 👍🏻👍🏻
the header about gave me a heart attack @SkyUK maybe word this better, thought u were gonna take me to court 🙄🙄 https://t.co/MlbdKZpcqT
@SkyUK your internet is by far the worst &amp; slowest I have ever had, absolutely woeful, will be changing provider ASAP
@SkyUK have you got problems with internet service in Leigh Sinton? Ridiculous how many times is been unavailable today!
@SkyUK "I am an existing customer" = Sorry, try again later. "I am a new customer" = Hi! How can I help? .... fine, I won't upgrade then...
@SkyUK ridiculous, I have been told that my iPhone won't connect to my new wifi box but I should contact Apple! Not had a problem before 😡😡
No internet again today 4th day in a row... 😡 @SkyUK this is getting ridiculous now!
@SkyUK Say what? 10 days? I can't wait for this new Ofcom ruling to come in. https://t.co/x6NDuUADkr
@SkyUK is there any reason why my Sky+HD Box would stop playing sound after pausing and rewinding? Have forced an update with no luck :(
@SkyUK why do i have to turn to the non HD channel everytime i want to watch my local BBC news!!!! #sortitout
@s_cruickshank @SkyUK last 6-8 weeks have been constant resets, engineer visit and they have no clue. utterly useless.
@SkyUK trying to get help from your online chat but no luck... when on earth will I get through
@SkyUK  thanks for all the mental anguish you've caused x
@SkyUK another recording ruined by the awful SkyQ. Before u ask: my config is fine. It's a poorly implemented solution.&amp; I pay £150 monthly?
Loved @idriselba in A Hundred Streets, great short film on @SkyUK @SkyMovies also the lampshades and art work featured were just 👌🏼
How funny our sky broadband stops working when they close at 9!!! @SkyUK
What's the issues with the broadband @SkyUK been down all day
@virginmedia 👋🏼 what's the best number to call to arrange a switch? @SkyUK have had my last pennies 🙅🏻
@SkyUK trying to call and you're telling me that my call will be answered within 20 mins . Don't do me any favours !! #TerribleService .
Had sky Q and it's worst thing ever, Forever saying connection problems and recordings not loading, we even have sky Wi-Fi at that!  @SkyUK
Marshalling @24HSERIES and will @SkyUK + @FIAWorldRX and @DunlopBTCC https://t.co/nmP4UPtB2P
@SkyUK skyQ box recorded wrong pg and on demand won't work.... it's episode 6 of a series-is this a known issue??
Glad you are back on @SkyUK Fantastic https://t.co/797eHishFb
@SkyUK screwing up before they've even installed the damn thing
@SkySports @SkyUK  Since you announced IE as the only supported browser (wtf?) the service has been intermittent at best! Sort it out #skyGo
@SkyUK is there any way I can watch Sky on a tv in another room without having to pay £144 a year ?
@SkyUK had emails that I've taken out a sky account - already have it - what # do I call to sort it out, think it's fraudulent
@aylg1987 can't listen to that bitter prick McCann. Cancelled @SkyUK because of the awful coverage of anything that isn't English PL pish
So I'm torn between @bt_uk  and @SkyUK for my broadband. 

Who wants me more?😂👌🏻
Upgraded to @SkyUK sports today, to find its extra £6 a month to get it in HD. Got Sky Q for UHD but extra for Sports but not anything else!
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam why can't I watch britains next top model on Sky go??? It's not showing up at all
@SkyUK is sky go still down? Having problems connecting
Great to see both these bad boys  featured  in #100Streets on @SkyUK Premiere. #prop #action #vehicles https://t.co/QBvAsFRfb2
@SkyUK rented a movie, having picture interference through the whole movie. Waste of money
Why wont my @SkyUK Go not let me watch my sky go as it says I'm not a customer for it but I am?
@SkyUK Why is my skygo not working?! Was working fine then "unexpected exception in network layer" and not worked since! Fed up now!!!!
@SkyUK per month and again the reception on the more expensive internet is worse than the cheaper one!! What's happening at Sky??
Txt from @SkyUK today confirming that my switch to unlimited Fibre will happen on the 28th
Cant wait
Good ridence shitty 4mb broadband
@SkyUK for Sky Q every month and getting worse service than before. We also upgraded our internet with Sky recently from £9 per month to £15
@SkyUK sometimes having to use the master box to make the secondary box work. Can take up to 10 mins to get it sorted out. We paying extra
@SkyUK in the left of the TV and nothing works. We then have to unplug the box at the back and re-plug it in, go through various menus
@SkyUK your new Sky Q box is rubbish. Box keeps switching off in middle of programmes or you turn the box on and you just get a tiny screen
@Ultra_Depeche If you're a @SkyUK customer, you can record the DM @TheBarrowlands gig on channel 980. 🎹🎸🎹

@BBCRedButton @BBC6Music
Congratulations @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK Officially worst broadband ever! Suppose to be fastest 🤔 https://t.co/mNlFWJOW22

@kwrowe @SkyUK spectacular grammar too.
@SkyUK Q multi room being installed tomorrow. Really hope the internet is strong enough to deal with it! 😂
Hmm, our @SkyUK box needed a forced system update today. Very odd. Normally pretty reliable :-( #FirstWorldProblems #corrupted
@SkyUK logic....send a new box and then when it fucks up the whole system and the ask for £490 to fix it...sound work sky fuckin cowboys
Paying all this money and the wifi has barely worked this weekend 😢 @SkyUK
Any news on why sky go gives error 4001 on the ps4 just looking for an answer on how to fix, just an answer @skyuk

@SkyUK how do I get out of my sky q contract? Had for almost year and is getting worse not better. Basically unwatchable on mini boxes.
Anyone work for @SkyUK and can kindly activate the current package/price I have for another 12/18 months? I'd be forever grateful 😘
@SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK
Thanks @SkyUK ! Only had to reset everything in my house in order to watch tv. Can put a man on the moon but can't watch tv.. #skyq
@WaltiePaulnuts @SkyUK Sky broadband is wank. It's their routers. Absolute dogshit.
Terrible broadband service for over 18 months and @SkyUK want to charge £50 for an engineer to attend. I'll just cancel you utter jokers.

It's such a relief to have @SkyUK back in the house after a good 3 or 4 years with a tivo box and #SkyQ is brilliant!!!
@SkyHelpTeam you need to use the @SkyUK account to ensure people know of schedule changes.
Yet again problems with sky Q box anyone else have nothing but problems with this box....need a better box #SkyQ  #problems @SkyUK
Speaking to a geordie girl in @SkyUK call centre makes the experience so much better 😂😂

@lgladdy Yeah. I know that *now*. Shame @SkyUK didn't make that clear at all before the first race this weekend. #fail
@SkyUK why's it so hard to ever get through to anyone? Live chat is always busy &amp; you call, get left on hold for so long and it cuts you off
So many #SkyQ reports off boxes constantly breaking down. My box is temperamental. Sort it out please @SkyHelpTeam @SkyUK wot do we pay 4?

@SkyUK who's idea was it to have a yellow and blue select bar? Fire them. It's ridiculous! Can hardly read it!
.@SkyUK are getting beyond useless. Can't access my broadband a/c online coz I have a tv a/c. Their solution, get a new e-mail address.
@SkyUK why does it take an absolute age to download a film since getting SkyQ, my Sky+ was so much better #yawn
My chat with a @SkyUK expert as I try to quit the internet. #amusing https://t.co/4KZo05nAWH
@SkyUK @IWC_Media Great series starting this week. Set your boxes , or even watch realtime (old school) https://t.co/BZjAVzJbzf
To make it more confusing @SkyUK hide the 4K content away in a completely different menu than the normal TV guide. Really poor design. #fail

Wow, @SkyUK Q is the fail that keeps on failing. 4K's only available on live broadcasts, not replays. No obvious way to record in 4K either.
@TalkTalk charged my elderly parents £65 to fix their equipment their engineer admitted was faulty 😠 ... I've advised them to move to @skyuk
Never use @TalkTalk. Really terrible service. Prices go up and up and up. They now want over £40 this month!#movingtosky @SkyUK
