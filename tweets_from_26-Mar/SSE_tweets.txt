@YourSSE @SSE Ultrafast fibre is soooo throttled....Trying to watch England ITV player.. Time to turn VPN on!!!!! I'll bypass the slowness!
And in case I am unusual @SSE my pay has not increased by anything like 19.5%
Hi, @SSE can you tell me what my options are for the same standard of service without a price hike of 19.5% please
@stevesamosa @TheFerryTavern @LinkingtheLocks @SSE #sankeycanal - getting that name out there, lol
@Alastair_JB @OVOEnergy @SSE I had one once. Company threatened to come round &amp; disconnect. Feel free I said. These flats are all electric!
I had a 'red' bill from @OVOEnergy telling me I owe them £300 for gas

Only problem is I've never used them and pay @SSE by monthly DD. FFS
Well, that's parked!!!!??? Thanks @BromfordLiving &amp; @SSE for being there everyday! https://t.co/guOUyj1Sud
