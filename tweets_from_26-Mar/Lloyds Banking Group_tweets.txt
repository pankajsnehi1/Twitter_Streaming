@AskLloydsBank It rarely happens though, but I guess that happens sometimes to someone.
@AskLloydsBank I guess you got me wrong way. I'm asking how to close my account without signature on a closing letter that I will send
@AskLloydsBank Is there a prob with future dated pyments? One set up a week ago for today for ¬£25 not made. From Lloyds to Halifax.
@AskLloydsBank I mean I don't remember what signature I wrote. Without signature, is it not possible for me to close my account?
@AskLloydsBank When I send a closing letter, if I don't remember my sign, how can I deal with it? Is there any other way to figure it out?
@AskLloydsBank When is everything gonna be up and running? I can't withdraw cash or access IB
@AskLloydsBank are you doing maintenance at the moment?
@AskLloydsBank Been with this bank since I was at high school and never had any problems staff are always willing to help.
@AskLloydsBank can I have a follow
@AskLloydsBank follow?
