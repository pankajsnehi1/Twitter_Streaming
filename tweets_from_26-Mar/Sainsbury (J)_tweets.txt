@sainsburys thank you Corey :) Be nice to have Sainsbury's locals rather than just the one big superstore :)
@sainsburys could someone contact me regarding an issue with your garment labelling please. Many thanks Ginette
@sainsburys @nectar  Can you remove me from your mailing list? I've moved abroad and the nectar info is still going to an old address
@sainsburys Thanks Ash! Done.
@schizoaffected @sainsburys if they're trying to get rid of the older stuff by selling it to online shoppers :/
@schizoaffected @sainsburys that should either be in the reduced section, or chucked out. Not sure if they're not checking properly or
@schizoaffected @sainsburys Everything? Wow! Tbh I've been disappointed with how short dated products are (1 or 2 days). These are products
@Naanster @sainsburys W-O-W! &lt;333 This would be a lovely treat. I am following and have retweeted. Thanks so much for the chance :)
