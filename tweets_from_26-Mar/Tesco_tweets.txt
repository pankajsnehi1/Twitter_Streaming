@Tesco Thank you
@Tesco ordered flowers for delivery for
Mother's Day and really not happy with the quality of them 🙁 Such a small, bad bunch for £20!
@Tesco to retain the customers you have, not nudge them to other retailers (which you have done with myself).
@Tesco ah, see I'm not the only one. Found the email notifying of charges, but tbh with your current financial position, I'd be doing more

Shocked at @Tesco staff at Bar Hill. Woman fell on escalator. No reaction until shouted at, despite emergency stop pushed. Appalling. #Tesco
