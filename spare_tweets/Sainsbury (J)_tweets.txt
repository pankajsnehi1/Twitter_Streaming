@ManchesterPSC @CockneyActivist @sainsburys @UkThom @uk_irresistible @WarOnWant disappointed with your policy #Sainsbury; we won't buy it
@ManchesterPSC @CockneyActivist @sainsburys @UkThom @uk_irresistible @WarOnWant stocking goods from Israel is unethical. It's a Apartheid
@sainsburys @Tesco Do your workers get sick pay from a broken limb? Cos if not. That's really "sick"

@sainsburys Thanks Faiza!
@ashtonparsonsuk @sainsburys thank you 🍀❤
@sainsburys sorry, Faiza! Didn't mean to misspell you.
@sainsburys thank you Fazia. Can I have some points please? U always give store vouchers, which are wasted as I use online shopping 😏
@sainsburys, it is true that it might be better if you had used “Sorry that [you] are not a” instead. ‘You’ are rather than ‘your’ are.
@sainsburys just a mistake I'm sure, but as a trans woman it hurts. Do you train your checkout staff in dealing with trans people?

@sainsburys No barcode, this was at the weekend so the package is gone, it was Cowley Rd, Oxford Sainsburys.
@sainsburys, I think you are confused. Your prices are higher than @WholeFoodsUK. See pricing stickers at all London stores.
Daryl, you are a legend. @sainsburys https://t.co/hvuz2wgJys
@sainsburys shame this is your response. The guy was great, one of the best people I've had deliver. Im annoyed at the JS system not him
@sainsburys Purchased at Selsdon branch. We don't have the barcode anymore, but surely all products are the same throughout all branches?
@Broon73 We're sorry to hear that, Claire. Do you have a @sainsburys store nearby? You may be able to find our range in there.
I miss my @sainsburys hummous 😌
