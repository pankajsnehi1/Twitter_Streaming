@easyJet not a misunderstanding. The hotel told us you had overbooked, and you were told about it, but we weren't informed.
@easyJet not true, it was less than 24 hrs in advance. I just want my train ticket reimbursed, not even asking for the ‚Ç¨250 fee.

@easyJet I requested my money back- can I please get that back soon?
@easyJet Thanks for replying Catanna, but we've already done this twice. Can you offer transfers to another Airport that isn't affected?
@easyJet I'm sure there's a better way of handling lost baggage ? It can't just go missing! I saw d bag being checked in. This is wrong.
Least helpful airline of all time @easyJet https://t.co/N18XLXxJJe
@Johnny__Mcr @easyJet supposed to finish tomorrow we can't fly back till Thursday
@juvadewe @easyJet To avoid any misunderstandings: Are you referring to yesterday's flight &amp; were any other documents checked at the gate?
Hurray! @taportugal finally into #FNC after holding. @easyJet now making their attempt. Other airlines watching with bated breath.
@joerayment91 @easyJet Don't forget to put a claim in, really easy in @easyJet website and paid within a week. TBH great customer service!
@easyJet I contacted you on the 5th about refunding my expenses after my bag went missing for 5 days. But I am yet to receive a reply
