@easyJet so would really appreciate it if you guys would handle this in a proper manner, instead of a short email to fob it off. Thank you.
@easyJet not a misunderstanding. The hotel told us you had overbooked, and you were told about it, but we weren't informed.
@easyJet not true, it was less than 24 hrs in advance. I just want my train ticket reimbursed, not even asking for the €250 fee.
@easyJet which I claimed for reimbursement. However, the reply of custsrvc is that I was informed "well in advance" of the cancellation
@easyJet hi. Last Monday my flight from Berlin was cancelled. I had to buy a train ticket to get home as it was return trip from Amsterdam.

@easyJet because the link you sent me to the hotels you arranged didn't work. I want compensation for the full amount.
@easyJet despite the fact I paid this on the day of my cancelled flight because I had to arrange an extra night at my hotel
@easyJet just told my claim for compensation has been denied because the receipt I provided is a 'pre flight arrangement'.

2/2 in return for cancelling our flights which were over £300 - absolutely disgusting @easyjet you should be ashamed!
.@neilwallis1 did you ever get a response from @easyjet or are you still waiting? 😄
Not the greatest fan of @easyJet bumped off a flight with no explication poor customer service and very rude staff who don't give a toss.
1/2 @easyJet are absolute crooks. Booked flights less than 48 hours ago and found out today I had unexpected surgery. They offered us £23

@KentGerman @easyJet likely is. I went on one of those a few years ago and it was only a 20 minute flight

@easyJet any response? Thanks
@easyJet Bonsoir, toujours aucune nouvelle de votre part après 1 mois, ça devient inquiétant et agaçant, que puis-je faire ?
@easyJet you have sent the same generic message every time yet NOTHING has been resolved do you want me to put the recording up @easyJet
changing booking on @easyjet let's check how does it work :D
@easyJet hello?
@berlinairport @easyJet Is EZY1898 affected by the strike in Berlin?
@easyJet hello, please reply to my two tweets and dm! urgent!
@easyJet you have surpassed yourselves. We paid £104 for transfers which you never provided. No response to my complaint. Want my money back

Tracked my sisters @easyJet flight from @BelfastAirport to @LPL_Airport  on @flightradar24 https://t.co/5KCUZ71NWg
@easyJet so the 19.45 from Krakow to LGW is delayed and you only announce this when we are about to board? Please explain.
@easyJet I have seen that, please can you confirm that EZY1898 will be running as planned? Thanks
@easyJet there won't be a next time after having to pay £40 for a taxi as there were no trains left running to get home.
When @easyJet's site won't work and you can't get any accommodation in Berlin that they PROMISED when you're stranded due to the strike! 😡
@easyJet hi! I can't find a link on your website for complaints, could you point me in the right direction please
@easyJet you have surpassed yourselves. You take £104 for transfers which you failed to provide and no response to my complaint 2 weeks ago.

Literally the worst evening's experience with the reigning champ of terrible flights, @easyJet! It's almost admirable how bad they do this.
@guardian Can your consumer champion help us get money we're owed from @easyJet - their service has been appalling!
