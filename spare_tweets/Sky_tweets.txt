@SkyUK it's an every day occurrence now. Message on my to, your Sky+HD box isn't getting a signal. I'm sick of it. #goingtovirgin

Time to switch internet providers. Connection with @SkyUK is crap &amp; they've now installed "shield" &amp; made a block list without permission.

What's the best broadband and line rental folks? Time to cancel Sky, too expensive, calls 20p a min! @SkyUK #ripoff
@SkyUK why are you ignoring me, i will bin it if I don't get a reply.
@SkyUK  received abysmal service - fed up of calling sky - can't you do anything right!!!!!!
#IWD2017 #sky5050 #BeBoldForChange Inspiring and emotional listening to @KatiePiper_ tell her story today @SkyUK
My last tweet was basically pointing out that @SkyUK are a bunch of useless cunts
We ordered @SkyUK broadband on 2nd Feb, they've now cancelled our order. Communication is shocking. Still no broadband a month after moving.
Have to say from this trip @SkyUK feels a great place to work! Great facilities - feels like they look after their staff!
@nickstadb @SkyUK while(confirmed) {sendConfirmation();sleep(14*60*60)}//confirmed is global as well!
sendCancellationBill();
Quite an aggressive @skyUK person on the phone in customer service. The engineer who came however, was brilliant.
