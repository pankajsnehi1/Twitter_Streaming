@Morrisons I have had some really miserable and unhelpful staff at the Newquay store(I know everyone has bad days) but she was amazing!
@daraobriain could be worse...they could have had a display like @Morrisons #4leafcloverisnotirish https://t.co/xegoweiiab
@Morrisons She played and joked with John, asked his name and went out of her way to make him laugh! She had no idea but she made my day!
@Morrisons and he was very grumpy! I got to the tills and I went self service as I was fed up! Carol came over as it was quiet!

@Morrisons thank you for cancelling our order last night without calling to let us know like every other supermarket does. Top work.
@Morrisons Yes Kimberley biscuits. Nearest store is St Albans.
@Morrisons I must admit it didn't get the attention it deserved as I was screaming at the WalesvIreland match, but it was good. Well done 😊

@Morrisons Can I speak to someone privately about this? It has now been resolved but the distress caused and impact was unnecessary.
@Morrisons ok, thanks. KTC alternative is awful. Loads of additives that just make it gloopy.
