@RoyalMail i sent two letters last week with first class stamps and neither has been delivered. Can I get them back somehow?
@RoyalMail I replied on 13th..............to Emma, not great I get contacted by a different person every time, still waiting for CEO details
@RoyalMail hi folks parcel sent to me the 13th record GK209341047GB. Tracker says it's getting processes. Will it be out today what address?
I want to be a post man @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail my parcel is lost and GLS hasn't update the tracking. I've lost important documents.
@RoyalMail It's ok, my sister has found the 'we missed you' card and is going to collect the parcel. Thank you anyway
@PostOffice @royalmail how much will a book of 6 1st class stamps cost from the 27th march please? After the increase Thanks
@RoyalMail having trouble locating my parcel and your automated service doesn't understand my tracking number
@RoyalMail many thanks. Had problem last week &amp; was told that the same info did not mean my items had been received by the DC?!
@RoyalMail I contacted the sender but they said to contact you, fingers crossed for today i suppose as no one can help me üò©
@RoyalMail I ordered several items from ebay but delivery address doesn't have  my apartment number. Is there anyone 2 contact to sort out?
@RoyalMail the normal note didn't come through hence confusion.
@RoyalMail no, but I must also note that I was in at the time of delivery - and am disappoint to say that no attempt at delivery was made.
@RoyalMail I've followed you so you can direct message me
@RoyalMail yes, 3 times. Sorting office seems to look for the most private mail &amp; redirect when no redirection required.
@RoyalMail can anyone confirm if the post box at Tedworth House SP9 7AJ is ever collected? Posted something at the weekend not recieved yet
@RoyalMail But how do I know you paid it? It's fine you saying you've paid it but without the receipt I have no way of proving that.
@RoyalMail done, thanks.
@RoyalMail thanks for getting back. Another tenant called Mount Pleasant and was told the building had been forgotten.  All resolved now.
@RoyalMail Yep! And it is very annoying
@RoyalMail it wasn't clear on my drive cam unfortunately but dalkeith base
@RoyalMail shouldn't you be able to use the tracking number to find out where it is? Otherwise what is the point in tracking something?!
@RoyalMail thanks but fortunately the lovely folk at @ElectronicMagUK are sending me another one. I don't usually rant but was so cross!
@RoyalMail I can confirm I'm now following. Please DM me and I will give details of where you can pick it up from.
@RoyalMail so therefore I will have to pay 70p to pick up from a local post office
@RoyalMail 4 miles isn't local. I live in EH3 and usually pick up from Haymarket delivery office but this has gone to Portobello

@RoyalMail Hi..i placed a couple of orders on your website. The items haven't yet been posted?
@RoyalMailStamps @RoyalMail @DavidBowieReal did you use helium balloons?
Nice one @RoyalMail - my item has. been 'progressing through your network' and has been 'on its way' for a month #jobsworths #fail üëçüèΩ
@RoyalMail back to my question. What if no card was left? The card lost scenario?? Can we check with the local sorting office??
@JUSTGARDENS I'm glad to hear you received it okay. Have you let @royalmail know as they deliver the mail? - Jess
@RoyalMail there is no need to. I have a defined footpath they need to walk on. Not across the grass. Leave it at that. Brief posties!!!!
@RoyalMail @royalmailnews - don't you think its poor that the delivery person does not fill out the card properly? Very low standards
@RoyalMail Can your "PO Box Deliver" service deliver to non-UK EU addresses?
@RoyalMail I checked as it came from the Netherlands but they don't have any tracking info.
@RoyalMail maybe this is something that should change then?! Customer service leaves a lot to be desired!
@RoyalMail Do postmen not like knocking on doors anymore. 2 something for you cards left in two days when we were in to answer door.
@RoyalMail The place it was sent refused to accept it so it's at local delivery office but recipient hasn't been asked 2 collect. Will DM
@RoyalMail parcel delivered to neighbour but not told who. Given unanswered no. by surly RM woman at delivery office. Please do something
@RoyalMail yes. KB144809695GB but I tried that and it only says it was posted.
@RoyalMail it's not me you've done over, you need to be tweeting @jakeysmall .... he's the one you've messed around
@RoyalMail no you don't. Tell pieties to use the path!!
@RoyalMail Expecting items, yes, and not sure if they were sent signed for. So it's a possibility.
@RoyalMail No, I didn't. I sent it from a post office and wasn't asked to include return address. Is there a way to get it back?
@jakeysmall @RoyalMail shocking! Never get answers
@Jonno591 I know your pain mate had some shit from @RoyalMail 3 calls and going to the depot to speak to the manger still nothing absolute üí©

@RoyalMail it has a tracking number which should show somewhere on your systems. This is ridiculous! Where is my parcel?

@RoyalMail is there any way this can be checked and confirmed so that I can contact the company for a refund?

@RoyalMail I've no idea who ordered it or what the number should be was just hoping you could do something so they know it's delivered
@RoyalMail not sure what it states as I'm not currently home. But kind of urgently need the package. Just wondered if you could check
@RoyalMail basically I have to wait and hope it doesn't make it there.. otherwise I don't get anything back? I'll take it higher if I must
@RoyalMail 1st class is next day no? So it is considered #delayed if posted on Thursday
@RoyalMail now I have to make a 200mile round trip at some point to collect the item, that's why I wanted it today as I would be there üò†
@RoyalMail yes it is, I don't have the card on me at the moment as it's at the office. There is even an intercom. It's not hard.
@RoyalMail cash couldn't have just fallen out without the folded paper it was in falling out too, so I suspect it was stolen en route
@RoyalMail will it be returned to the sender at all?
@RoyalMail claim won't be made as wrong service was used for cash. Sent from Llanelli to same area, so only one sorting office responsible
It's a miracle that @RoyalMail can deliver any post to the correct addresses given their #shambolic service

@RoyalMail can you advise, is there a backlog of parcels being delivered from Leicester?

@RoyalMail I have contacted RM about delivery men not using the provided paths many times. Seems ignorance is a requirement fir a job!

That's five cards sent to two destinations, all sorted #StPatricksDay #MothersDay #Birthday #Anniversary @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail it does have my address on the back 'of undelivered return to sender'. So confusing. I've reposted it twice.
@RoyalMail I'm going to be travelling for a while. No other way to check the update of a claim without sending everything again?

@RoyalMail I appreciate you looking into for me, and I know it's not your fault. It's just frustrating to not be able to do anything. :(
@RoyalMail Why is this rude and aggressive man still working at Royal mail?
@RoyalMail so does that mean @PostOffice has delayed it then?
@Roesch81L I've spoken to the branch and they don't have any items there. What did @royalmail advise? - Jess
@RoyalMail Yeah please, that'd be great - would like to make sure it doesn't happen again.
.@RoyalMail Tracking number or no, you are liable for packages lost through your service. So DO you plan to give back my money? I'm waiting.
@RoyalMail Romford postman forced letter in and broke my letterbox.
When I get a @RoyalMail fee-to-pay card, of course what I *really* want to do is register on a website, instead of just paying the ¬£1.50.
@RoyalMail It must be a glitch with the @junecloud Deliveries app!

Thanks for clarifying.
@RoyalMail you'd actually charged me 9 to deliver a package that would have cost me 2/3 If I'd have posted it then add on the 8ish for HMRC

RT @MeloYelo69: @RoyalMail exorbitant cost of next day Special Delivery before 1pm is definitely not worth the money, still says come back‚Ä¶
@RoyalMail when can I get my compensation? I already filed a claim and I haven't recieved my money yet.
@RoyalMail no. I organised it through online chat. And then wasn't even attempted to be delivered.  Waited in all day for nothing.
@RoyalMail it was sent 3rd March 1st class. It was a larger envelope as it had a number of smaller ones inside. Would 2 stamps be enough?
@RoyalMail it doesn't - my flat resides in the same building as the business below it , has a different postcode - on finder - explain ?
@RoyalMail yes it was, it was left at 7am that day. Yes, we have a buzzer and a bell, both working. I managed to go to the office to claim.
@dummiediaries You'll need to raise this with @royalmail as they deliver the mail and we're separate companies. - Jess

@RoyalMail Btw i chose signed &amp; tracked shipping but why i can‚Äôt track my item from point to point?
@RoyalMail Eventually found it in the back garden between the waste bins. It had been thrown over a 6ft wall and was damp from the rain üôÅ
@RoyalMail i‚Äôve contacted Pos Malaysia, they said they haven‚Äôt received the item yet. The item has not arrived in malaysia.
@RoyalMail https://t.co/lkCOy2hQ98
@RoyalMail T/U. I understand, but it's VERY unsatisfactory for a tracked48 item of mail to still be traversing the UK 7 days after posting.
@RoyalMail thank you!
@RoyalMail .. get the drivers phone number and ask him where he put it, if he did deliver it!
@RoyalMail ... they dont have it! Really want the parcel today and its a pain! Phone customer relations but was wondering if i could...
@RoyalMail At 10.10 you said you delivered my parcel to a neighbour and I never recieved a card! Knocked on all my neighbours doors and....
@RoyalMail we needed these documents urgently, because it was so late we had to get another copy couriered by UPS at great expense as backup
@RoyalMail I'll finish your job for you yes You've delivered a package to me but for someone 1 mile away I'll repost for you. #getitright

@RoyalMail - it was only sent first class is that ok to claim?
@RoyalMail my claim for a lost parcel is well over 30 days. How do I chase this, your website has no options?
@RoyalMail ah I see then I'm somewhat disappointed that it took 26 days for a letter delivered from London to HK.
@RoyalMail a redelivery supposed to be made available today. No time was mentioned so why should it only be there later in the day?

@RoyalMail I live at 2 addresses, since one address is printed on driving licence, I cannot use that to collect posts for my other address?!
@RoyalMail No because it was to be delivered to work. Where is it getting returned to? Can I find out the exact reason?
@RoyalMail hi can you direct message me please as i have a problem with a delivery im expecting
@RoyalMail been waiting for a parcel and still not here after three days is it possible i could have missed it &amp; postman didnt leave a note?
@RoyalMail cant even deliver a letter. Will change all my deliveries to reliable carrier.
@RoyalMail 2nd March, exactly a week ago
@RoyalMail it's been delivered today (only two days late) Thanks for contacting me though.
@RoyalMail yep, it was trackable and confirmed to have arrived at the DO
@RoyalMail no but thats not the point, its his job to deliver the packages, not moan about it and ask what ive ordered
.@feelunique @RoyalMail which is why I paid for next day delivery!!! Absolutely livid.
.@feelunique @RoyalMail so not only have I paid for nothing. But I can't collect it from the post office until tomorrow. When I'm away.
@RoyalMail Hey, had a package that arrived from the US to London on the 17th. Guessing with customs? LF109941454US, when should i worry?
When you order something next day delivery @feelunique, and the @RoyalMail driver doesn't even knock on your door.
@RoyalMail For special delivery mail arriving a day late (posted Tues 10.30am, delivering today), what is the compensation procedure?
@RoyalMail fair enough - the sender will get his fee back - yet its me who is without the important delivery!
@RoyalMail My tracked parcel status is 'Mis-Sort Scan at Delivery Office - Redirected' at my local PO, any chance of getting it today?
@RoyalMail OK, thanks, have made further contact with @JLcustserv.

@RoyalMail your customer service is disgusting. Your welcome.
@AmazonHelp says it's @RoyalMail which is surprising, they usually always deliver on time
@RoyalMail both from same company shipped same day.
@RoyalMail strange. This was from an Amazon seller and according to them it was posted on the 26th of February... expected by 14th of March
@RoyalMail can you tell me why my parcel from US arrived a week ago but my sisters hasn't? They both left London at the same time

well done @RoyalMail  2 from 3 letters posted by me this year lost!  66% failure record. Plus one birth certificate missing.  Appalling!
@RoyalMail My Fianc√©e is going to try and collect it today. However, not knowing if they will even have the package it may be a wasted trip.

Why, exactly, @royalmail, is my delivery sent to an office for G33 and G34 when I live in G69?  Are you really that incompetant?
But then, @royalmail, why do I have to go 10 miles instead of the local delivery office? I'm breathless with anticipation of your "answer"
This may shock you, @royalmail, not every one of your customers wants to go on a jaunt every time one of your lazy-arse staff screws up.
So I asked some idiot at @RoyalMail why my designated delivery office is 10 miles away, when there's one 5 miles up the road.  "Uhhhh...."
