@Jlough85 @BTGroup group like say rail system and let each one invest into it like a holding company that just my view
@Jlough85 @BTGroup final thought UK needs to invest ¬£100bn in all the telecom systems personally think alll should be allowed to own as one
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup yes u too m8 Take care
@Jlough85 @BTGroup anyway sorry for ranting and raving and it was nice talking with you take care john
@Jlough85 @BTGroup that in its self is staggering and 5G there talking of will not be able to cope with current infrastructure we have
@Jlough85 @BTGroup and 4G system is creaking and may run out did you know UK accounts for 50% of lf DATA used on mobiles networks
@Jlough85 @BTGroup has plan A and B on that Uk needs at least 10 DATA storage areas as well on top so talking ¬£3bn each just for those
@Jlough85 @BTGroup in end ofcom may come up with a plan in future based on some of ideas other have put forward and am sure lady who runs
@Jlough85 @BTGroup got bt CEO email if want it lol
@Jlough85 @BTGroup new company along with BT on top and GOV adding another ¬£5bn god did BT go mad about use at time
@Jlough85 @BTGroup and we put our proposals forward on it like many other groups who also did but other telcos would of invest ¬£5bn into
@Jlough85 @BTGroup and we went to ofcom and gov ministers about it last year so new deal is halfway deal been done am being honest with you
@Jlough85 @BTGroup i worked for group who wanted open reach removed from BT and idea was to allow other telecom to invest a new system
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup I feel your pain m8 te future is bright for All providers who use the BT network im sure
@Jlough85 @BTGroup if open reach had to lay a new fibre system across whole of UK how many years would that take do you think
@Jlough85 @BTGroup and has break down into small lots to send lol i think its funny when starts ranting and raving about it
@Jlough85 @BTGroup dead slow honest and she needs net for all her quantum physicist stuff she send about 3 gigs of DATA through system
@Jlough85 @BTGroup well that a start and then i hope even more faster speeds and fibre one day my wife who is Japanese thinks virgin speed
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup G Fast is the next big thing at 300mb speeds on the BT network
@Jlough85 @BTGroup what isd next new thing open reach have coming out
@Jlough85 @BTGroup system i think 12 years in fact i been customer
@Jlough85 @BTGroup i no in fact i use both BT and virgin in my flat for telecoms am even a BT mobile customer not 02 when BT used vodafone
@Jlough85 @BTGroup BT needs sort out its pension delefct i mean 2nd biggest in world and at ¬£8.8bn that is one hell of a lot of money
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup believe me we are always trying to improve and coming up with new incentives
@Jlough85 @BTGroup think long term and that is what get me angry about UK everything is short term and brit way am sad to say
@Jlough85 @BTGroup open reach needs to be given some path to do what it wants for its customers and for country and business we need
@Jlough85 @BTGroup john was not having ago at you and yes bet brilliant at your job and you care about customers as well but god
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup here's to the future. I love my job and passionate bout what I do we all want what's best
@Jlough85 @BTGroup want from new setup i bet you have list a mile long
@Jlough85 @BTGroup as have a new chairman,board,CEO and i hope they will be forward thinking and may be listen to their staff and what they
@Jlough85 @BTGroup i just want open reach be a vibrant new company with best technology on earth just have see what future brings
@Jlough85 @BTGroup they going backwards in somethings now
@Jlough85 @BTGroup who went totally 3G problem was you could not use GSM or 1 or 2G and bad mistake but first in world but now even in japan
@Jlough85 @BTGroup and not forward god we use be the generator for telecoms technology like3G ETC we use have it first apart from japan
@Jlough85 @BTGroup this what we are going to do people would be prepared to wait for something like that we really are going backwards
@Jlough85 @BTGroup i just wish john for open reach to put down fibre and get ride of copper and upgrade  all the way and say in ten years
@Jlough85 @BTGroup as they have fitted a new box in our building and think first one moves to them on Monday hey ho happy days and decent MB
@Jlough85 @BTGroup i no work for open reach and many of them would like to change and in fact many in my build are moving to virgin
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup I am openreach not BT I work I behalf of all providers who use te BT network just wanna make that clear
@GLOBALECOM1 @BTGroup G fast is being tested in certain areas now 300mb
