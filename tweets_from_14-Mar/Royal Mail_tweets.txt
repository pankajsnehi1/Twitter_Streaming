@RoyalMail and FYI the SAME EXACT THING happened when I was waiting on three paperback editions of the Harry Potter books last year
@RoyalMail ah i see... do you know what might have happened then? could it be that no-one has been at the recipient's house when delivered?
@RoyalMail well that is a LOAD if ever I read one! I have been WAITING for THREE parcels and NOT ONE OF THEM has arrived...
@RoyalMail the missing one was first. The opened one was first recorded delivery. Had to pick is one up.

@RoyalMail I received a text and email today to say you tried to deliver a package but you haven't left a card so I can't collect it!
Reply to @RoyalMail i shall. The tracking number says it's still in your network, as it's been two weeks, perhaps you've lost it. ?
@RoyalMail You expect me to travel 9 miles to an office because you're too lazy to update records?  Pretty pathetic!

@RoyalMail we repeat: if you offer this service the legitimate presumption is that POs will accept packages with freepost name. THEY ARE NOT
@RoyalMail so someone has checked if it was taken back to the warehouse? And ok
@RoyalMail it's 70% of PO branches, not one that's not accepting- and yes we have taken up with them and they point to you.
@RoyalMail so basically you don't know where you left it? I get no card, no details and a lost parcel? No wonder I use UPS.

@RoyalMail yes- problem was delivery address was wrong in 1st place, but landlord of house confirmed it was given back to postman by tenants
@RoyalMail have done but this isn't the first time and I'm more than 200 miles from the intended destination of the letter
@RoyalMail You have to follow me back otherwise I can't.  I haven't see any further cards, so they haven't done a good follow up job
@RoyalMail yes they haven't received it yet and it was sent on 03/03
@RoyalMail i have no idea.
@RoyalMail so does that mean it would have gone to the address? It was a recorded delivery.

This time tomorrow our Chairman will be on stage with @RoyalMail and @intel at @CloudExpoEurope talking #analytics https://t.co/z5e3QegrlX
@RoyalMail yes. I was just wondering, as I still haven't had a dispatch email?
@RoyalMail when I send a letter from turkey to the uk, does it come directly to you or someone else in between if at airport who can I ring
I'm not a stamp collector but had to order these. Thank you @RoyalMail for the #DavidBowie Limited Edition stamps. https://t.co/TUn5jRVSkd
@RoyalMail done.
@RoyalMail @PostOffice  Shocking customer service and total refusal to accept responsibility- both of you. Sort yourselves out

@RoyalMailStamps @RoyalMail @DavidBowieReal that's good. The reason I'm interested is helium is earth has a finite amount of helium.
@RoyalMail @PostOffice if RM advertise a service then we have a right to assume that PO will accept that service. This is ridiculous
@leipperm @RoyalMail @DavidBowieReal Our behind the scenes Twitter video - coming soon - will explain all!üéà
@RoyalMail Yodel delivered it to a neighbour who gave it back to the postman (assuming a Royal Mail postman)

@RoyalMail Hi..i placed a couple of orders on your website. The items haven't yet been posted?
@RoyalMailStamps @RoyalMail @DavidBowieReal did you use helium balloons?
Nice one @RoyalMail - my item has. been 'progressing through your network' and has been 'on its way' for a month #jobsworths #fail üëçüèΩ
@RoyalMail back to my question. What if no card was left? The card lost scenario?? Can we check with the local sorting office??
@JUSTGARDENS I'm glad to hear you received it okay. Have you let @royalmail know as they deliver the mail? - Jess
@RoyalMail there is no need to. I have a defined footpath they need to walk on. Not across the grass. Leave it at that. Brief posties!!!!
@RoyalMail @royalmailnews - don't you think its poor that the delivery person does not fill out the card properly? Very low standards
@RoyalMail Can your "PO Box Deliver" service deliver to non-UK EU addresses?
@RoyalMail I checked as it came from the Netherlands but they don't have any tracking info.
@RoyalMail maybe this is something that should change then?! Customer service leaves a lot to be desired!
@RoyalMail Do postmen not like knocking on doors anymore. 2 something for you cards left in two days when we were in to answer door.
@RoyalMail The place it was sent refused to accept it so it's at local delivery office but recipient hasn't been asked 2 collect. Will DM
@RoyalMail parcel delivered to neighbour but not told who. Given unanswered no. by surly RM woman at delivery office. Please do something
@RoyalMail yes. KB144809695GB but I tried that and it only says it was posted.
@RoyalMail it's not me you've done over, you need to be tweeting @jakeysmall .... he's the one you've messed around
@RoyalMail no you don't. Tell pieties to use the path!!
@RoyalMail Expecting items, yes, and not sure if they were sent signed for. So it's a possibility.
@RoyalMail No, I didn't. I sent it from a post office and wasn't asked to include return address. Is there a way to get it back?
@jakeysmall @RoyalMail shocking! Never get answers
@Jonno591 I know your pain mate had some shit from @RoyalMail 3 calls and going to the depot to speak to the manger still nothing absolute üí©
@RoyalMail to get it myself. The post office is super far away and I don't own a car. How am I supposed to get there? This is outrageous
@RoyalMail you didn't even try to deliver my parcel.. I pay a fortune, my flatmate is at home, but you just put a paper saying that I have

@RoyalMail it has a tracking number which should show somewhere on your systems. This is ridiculous! Where is my parcel?
@RoyalMail it's a work contract that's been sent and some stuff could be missing since it's been opened loads by someone at the mail centre.
@RoyalMail is there any way this can be checked and confirmed so that I can contact the company for a refund?

@RoyalMail .... please how do I find out if a parcel that I should have received is at Chester le street sorting office awaiting collection.
@RoyalMail I've no idea who ordered it or what the number should be was just hoping you could do something so they know it's delivered
@RoyalMail not sure what it states as I'm not currently home. But kind of urgently need the package. Just wondered if you could check
@RoyalMail basically I have to wait and hope it doesn't make it there.. otherwise I don't get anything back? I'll take it higher if I must
@RoyalMail 1st class is next day no? So it is considered #delayed if posted on Thursday
@RoyalMail now I have to make a 200mile round trip at some point to collect the item, that's why I wanted it today as I would be there üò†
@RoyalMail yes it is, I don't have the card on me at the moment as it's at the office. There is even an intercom. It's not hard.
@RoyalMail cash couldn't have just fallen out without the folded paper it was in falling out too, so I suspect it was stolen en route
@RoyalMail will it be returned to the sender at all?
@RoyalMail claim won't be made as wrong service was used for cash. Sent from Llanelli to same area, so only one sorting office responsible
It's a miracle that @RoyalMail can deliver any post to the correct addresses given their #shambolic service

@RoyalMail Will do!
@RoyalMail if delivery was unsuccessful today, can I collect from my local collection office (2 mins from my house), at 1.30pm today?

@RoyalMail it was a free post service for mazuma mobile. They say it's a 1st class stamp they provide

@RoyalMail but it's not illegal to send an item they haven't paid for? That's stolen. So you've sent something they stole from me..
@RoyalMail so i've started to receive my mail at my new address now - so not sure why this is still happening at my parents address.
@RoyalMail as of yesterday - yes. Also - the redirection was supposed to have ended and moved to a different address  last week.
@RoyalMail thankyou
@RoyalMail yeah how do I make a complaint that bypasses your customer service phone team which I might add have done nothing to help
@RoyalMail I made a claim for lost post last month but cannot find how to chase up compensation. Is there an email for customer services?
