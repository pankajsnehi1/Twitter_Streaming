@SkyUK Really slow broadband in Cookham, Berks.  Also stops completely when planes go overhead.  You put the price up and service declines.
If you can't get to speak to anyone @SkyUK try @bt_uk speaking to someone after around 2 minutes.... #believeinbetter

Having terrible problems switching from @SkyUK ADSL to @Plusnet fibre. No phone or internet since last Wednesday. May also lose my number.
@StopFundingHate @bt_uk @BritishGas @SKODAUK @Honda @Screwfix @SkyUK @CR_UK guys common, daily mail, really?!
@StopFundingHate @bt_uk @BritishGas @SKODAUK @Honda @Screwfix @SkyUK @CR_UK Please stop funding hate! Why must I do this every morning?
No Internet this morning @SkyUK is terrible
@SkyUK why do you have to pay for certain box sets?

@SkyUK this has been busy since 6pm yesterday. Will I ever get through? ☹️ https://t.co/8c8xgamHDM
Pretty close to moving from @SkyUK. @virginmedia @bt_uk if a customer asks for unlimited broadband do you give them it &amp; charge them or not?
@SkyUK :"we promise you 12-19Mbit/s". What's your excuse? this has been the speed for the last few months. When called were told its normal
Netflix has let me down but @SkyUK has my back. Just found veep!
