@AskLloydsBank my bank card ends this month. Should I have received my new one by now?
@AskLloydsBank Hi, the online banking UI is showing wrong currency characters for the search statements feature. Se‚Ä¶ https://t.co/g8NbYIu3I1
@AskLloydsBank still awaiting response
@AskLloydsBank thought the point of an app was the convenience of not having to use desktop,so no help there then
@O2 bank said speak to yourselfs @AskLloydsBank
@AskLloydsBank On the 28th of March, will I be able to return my old one pound coins for the brand new one pound coins?
@AskLloydsBank OK submitted
@AskLloydsBank Feedback for your web devs on some annoying issues: https://t.co/wnaQ4iO67x
@O2 im not sure. Got a new phone today but wont let me log onto personal banking. @AskLloydsBank said could be cos of new sim &amp; iemi number?
@AskLloydsBank Being told the bank didn't have to tell me why I had to spend 20 mins regaining access to my own money was not fun.
@AskLloydsBank said il give it till tomorrow as its a new phone and may not be fully registered yet
@AskLloydsBank im on a new device. With a new sim. They said to phone @O2 and ask to link number with the emei number ?
@AskLloydsBank Debit card. Blocked for no disclosable reason. Took a 20 min phone call to get unblocked. My time. My phone. Your customer.
@AskLloydsBank booked based on the reward
@AskLloydsBank the terms and conditions of the reward for Hilton are vague. Am I still eligible if staying at a Hampton by Hilton tonight?
@AskLloydsBank both. Just phoned customer services and they say it could be cos its a new sim and iemi number ain't registered to sim yet?
@asklloydsbank hello, I have a question regarding cashback rewards.
@AskLloydsBank cant log on, stuck in a loop says rest password and memorable info. I do that go to log on again and says the same
@AskLloydsBank ok thanks
@AskLloydsBank is there a way to do it via email rather than calling?
Annoyed with @AskLloydsBank applying an apparently random block on my card and being unable or unwilling to state why. "We don't have to."
@AskLloydsBank hi, how do you deactivate a device, it says I have more registered than the allowed number? Thanks
https://t.co/GqDCiNDfm2 3 days left to listen1.09 interview how #HBOS destroyed my business @AskLloydsBank police commissioner rant 1.28!

@AskLloydsBank I'm stuck in Leeds with ¬£30 for the next 3 days cause my bank has been low and I'm on last min business trip w/ no help!!
@AskLloydsBank changing bank, won't let me have an overdraft or any sort of emergency money when other banks offer this. (Part 1)
@AskLloydsBank what time are they open until?
@AskLloydsBank got my club Lloyds account. No contactless card but an email to tell me how to use contactless and no rewards either.
@AskLloydsBank Have tried to call customer services 3 times this afternoon and each time the call has dropped out üòï
@AskLloydsBank...it says it can't recognise my details. How can I get a new user ID number?
@AskLloydsBank Can't remember my user ID for my online account but when I put in my details after clicking 'forgotten ID'...
@AskLloydsBank classic
@AskLloydsBank I'm getting text messages on my mobile phone from 07860035283 but I don't bank with you
@AskLloydsBank is there a way of getting a contactless card before my card expires in 2020?

@AskLloydsBank no i didn't. I wasn't going to keep people waiting any longer behind me and there was a Q for reception.
@AskLloydsBank well congrats for the poor service at your #Colchester branch. 4 customers in front, half hour wait,‚Ä¶ https://t.co/xd5hZ3EDVN
@AskLloydsBank  Have online account. Try to buy/donate stuff. Some things get past Verified by visa, some don't. Am always in credit
@AskLloydsBank ah okay. Thanks for the reassurance!
@AskLloydsBank Lloyds seem to be running some kind of blacklist on my account, and am only able to send money to organizations THEY approve!
@AskLloydsBank Do you know how long this will take? It's worrying me that they say they've processed it and my item has been dispatched :/
@AskLloydsBank please could I dm you
@AskLloydsBank No it's not cleared on my full statement (other payments from that day have though)
@AskLloydsBank Hi, I've got a pending credit card transaction and wondered what this means? The payment has cleared with the retailer
@AskLloydsBank appointment please as I need to switch to your bank asap due to problems with my current bank.
@AskLloydsBank hi I've got an appointment at the Gloucester branch on the 22nd but can't make it due to work. Can I have a sooner appoint...

@AskLloydsBank Is Stratford Westfield branch open till 7pm to change my address or is it just the ATMs that accessible until 7pm?
@AskLloydsBank oh and you didn't think to tell me that when you gave me the phone number. Great customer service. Will close my account
@AskLloydsBank 2/2 rude and embarrassing. No questions asked when paying money in üôÑ luckily my reasons for needing my money were good enough
@AskLloydsBank completely appalled by the 'service' just received. Interrogation required before letting me have MY money! 1/2
Funally found my old @AskLloydsBank moneybox. Sadly it was empty. https://t.co/rWgH4YBKkE
Wondering why "https://t.co/ET5EoyrKpN" needs to see my bank transactions with @AskLloydsBank. Doesn't make me feel very secure.
@ThreeUKSupport I am with @AskLloydsBank and the number is +44 1702 278270
@AskLloydsBank they were too busy eating their lunch to worry bout the large que of customers
@AskLloydsBank also the website doesn't show Esher branch as still existing. Is this right?
@AskLloydsBank why do you have this? I have a number to call direct but it's not working today. I don't expect to pay to call local bank
@AskLloydsBank got a text saying to call this number 03301330873 as account suspended. Scam?
Answering ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô questions when your @AskLloydsBank card that was blocked feels worse than getting interrogated by cops.
@AskLloydsBank I've just tried it and I can, thanks for the reply
