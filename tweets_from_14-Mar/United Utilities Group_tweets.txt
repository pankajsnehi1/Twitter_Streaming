@unitedutilities but it looks like a night off work if they coming back tomorrow to finish the job
@unitedutilities don't need anyone to call, just wanted to know why we weren't informed, I know as a night worker I'm in the minority
@unitedutilities it's not, it's pre planned to sort out water pressure at a house opposite
@unitedutilities why don't you put notice through local doors informing of works, I work nights and been woken up by UU drilling outside
@unitedutilities I assume it'll all go over my head then. We just used to enjoy walking around there so wondered when it's back open
@unitedutilities We're still having issues
@unitedutilities @samuriinbred Puntastic! I couldn't paw-sibly continue with anymore without risking embarrassment... 🐈
@AFandango @unitedutilities Oh, I'm very fur-miliar with puns, although I felt my feline one would be mew-sic to your ears.
@samuriinbred @unitedutilities where did you claw that pun from?
@unitedutilities many thanks, MCC highways should be aware too via Cllr Manco
@unitedutilities ha, ha, brilliant idea (appreciating the crustacean themed back reference also 😁) #8outof10catsprefer
@unitedutilities @AFandango certainly gave me paws for thought.
@samuriinbred @unitedutilities it's not so much the act of drinking, more the issue of him turning off the tap when finished...! #watermeter

@unitedutilities sorry I binned the card! I'm sure it was this afternoon  tho?
@unitedutilities thanks for the info, but I've never lived anywhere with this many water issues, time for a permanent solution?
@unitedutilities again...?

@AFandango @unitedutilities Anthony, I have a feline that nothing you do will stop your cat drinking where he wants. Embrace his rebellion.
@unitedutilities Good morning, my cat will only drink water direct from the kitchen tap; how can I purrsuade him to use his bowl instead? 😻
