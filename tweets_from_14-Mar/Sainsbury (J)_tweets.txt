@sainsburys no way to access money unless I go all the way to the bank. Absolute joke. And no there was nothing wrong with the card.
@sainsburys I've already cancelled my card, now have to wait FIVE WORKING DAYS for another because of your ATM. Didn't even ask for my pin!
@sainsburys Caldy Valley, Chester. They still haven't put a sign on it saying not to use it. Probably going to happen to someone else!!
@RacingPost I don't know where the problem lies, but @sainsburys are scanning the wrong price on today's paper.
