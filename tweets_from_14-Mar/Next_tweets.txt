@nextofficial I couldn't book it all on mobile view or app (the slots dont show) The sale slots only show on desktop view via laptop.
Not impressed @nextofficial Sale time slots don't show on phone so have missed the first ones as couldn't get onto laptop until now.
@nextofficial I paid for a time slot delivery 16.00 to 17.00. They came to early so missed it. I dont understand why?

@nextofficial thank you. This isn't the case with your adult clothes though, when the size is bigger it is the same cost.
@nextofficial sorry yes I am :)
@nextofficial this has still not been resolved on yours website. I'm surprised you've not had more complaints so far.

@nextofficial 2/2 also, since you don't stock maternity wear in your stores I have no interest in buying any from you.
@nextofficial 1/2 you've sent me a mailer, yet I have never given you my address. How do I get my details removed from your database?
@nextofficial thank you for trying
@nextofficial does it matter that I can't find the jeans on your web site? My closest store is Whiteley, just want to be sure.
