@easyJet_press @easyJet #easyjet is not that #easy
As if @easyJet have cancelled my flights to London twice now, wee bit gutting when we've paid money for accommodation 🙄😬
@easyJet Hello. For my booking I've used first and last names but not my middle name which is on passport. I assume this is not an issue.

@richbayley80 @easyJet @doritosyndrome exactly, should be thanking you for a great campaign idea!
@easyJet @doritosyndrome what usage regulations do they violate ?
@doritosyndrome @easyJet no problem. Brilliant stuff 👌

@easyJet I've booked 2 flights today then found them cheaper with @Ryanair do you price match or do I need to cancel and book with them? 😍

@easyJet I have still not received and money can you help me?
Impressed with @easyJet 's handling of the airport strike. BnB and well organised flight today. Cabin crew on the 6820 were fab! 👏
Why in the 21st century are @easyJet insisting all electronic devices are turned off for landing including iPads.... WTF????
@easyJet I've had no information from you re the Berlin airport strikes. I'm due to fly tomorrow night, when will I find out if I'm flying?
@easyJet cabin bag = no handbag allowed = nowhere to put phone/passport =have to dig through cabin bag to relocate at security/gate.
@easyJet thank you Kat! It wasn't finding the information I had an issue with. It was the information itself.
@easyJet you've missed my point, 12 hours later. Why does your app iOS remove details of a delayed flight, after the "departure" time?
@Chipps @Monarch @easyJet never seen Fight Club?
@easyJet I think I may have lost my driving licence on the delayed EZY406 from Glasgow to Bristol. Is there a way I can check.

@jet2tweets thanks. I spoke with him and he is at faro airport. @easyJet plane from LGW just tried to land and aborted.Heading to Canaries!!
Argh. @easyJet couldn't get down into #FNC on their first attempt despite @taportugal sneaking in. Hotac so limited… https://t.co/yylgKZGubf
@STN_Airport @easyJet I'm referring to yesterdays' flight. Ticket was checked, ID wasn't. Not the ladies' fault with the timeframe she had.

@easyJet Sorry Catarina...
@easyJet after flight cancellation on 16/02 still no news on expense request despite 9 customer service calls!   Please advise?
@easyJet Thanks for replying Catanna, but we've already done this twice. Can you offer transfers to another Airport that isn't affected?
@easyJet I'm sure there's a better way of handling lost baggage ? It can't just go missing! I saw d bag being checked in. This is wrong.
@Johnny__Mcr @easyJet supposed to finish tomorrow we can't fly back till Thursday
@juvadewe @easyJet To avoid any misunderstandings: Are you referring to yesterday's flight &amp; were any other documents checked at the gate?
Hurray! @taportugal finally into #FNC after holding. @easyJet now making their attempt. Other airlines watching with bated breath.
@joerayment91 @easyJet Don't forget to put a claim in, really easy in @easyJet website and paid within a week. TBH great customer service!
@easyJet I contacted you on the 5th about refunding my expenses after my bag went missing for 5 days. But I am yet to receive a reply
@Johnny__Mcr @easyJet At the moment the flight EZY1897 tomorrow is on time. For more information, please contact your airline #service
Another (extra) day in Madeira, another view. Not so nice from pretty shitty hotel courtesy of @easyJet https://t.co/T1qSbpZPi7

@juvadewe Hi Julius. Could you please give us your flight number for us to pass this on to the @easyJet's handling agent. Thank you.
@joerayment91 you take the piss, @easyJet
@JenClaude @easyJet thanks Jen! EasyJet have been no help with the crossword.
@lookitssimon @easyJet we called them. They said 'arrange your own way back and we'll reimburse you' or other option was flight on Friday.

@joerayment91 @easyJet shit show. Why can't they arrange another plane to go to another airport? Nobbers
Anyone flew @easyJet with a Peli and a rucksack? Do I really need to pack the rucksack in the suitcase? Just a laptop in rucksack...
When you’re trying to be customer friendly but your algorythm fails,
@easyJet: https://t.co/8HJ5gS98Jt
@STN_Airport @easyJet Hi, why wasn't my ID checked before i boarded my plane? Doesnt feel safe at all. First check was after we landed.
@lookitssimon @easyJet train. We're changing here for a train to Brussels.
@KRingsdore @easyJet I am horrified!
@claudiwootten @jet2tweets Inbound Zurich and Lisbon just circling,soon to be joined by @easyJet from Gatwick.Im afraid i think divert again

@easyJet morning. flying to majorca next week cycling. what is the policy/recco for CO2 canisters to inflate tyres, hold or hand luggage?
@joerayment91 I feel like you have something you want to say to @easyJet.
@easyJet well?
@easyJet hello, can you purchase a laptop bag for a UK flight? Laptop won't fit in the carry on bag...
@joerayment91 @easyJet erm.. they're making you get a bus?!

@easyJet chaos at Lisbon this morning https://t.co/DtiOWFrdgy
@easyJet I've sent it DM please reply
@LeBruce @easyJet BA for the win 🙌✈️
@easyJet ...absolutely terrible experience with easyjet....never again...
@easyJet wasted all day (6.10 am to 6.10 pm)  at Edinburge airport, thanks to unhelpful easyjet crew..and had to pay £51 for another ticket.
@easyJet ..and book another flight, which was at 6.10 pm..to see, gates were open till 6.03pm...how ridiculous...had to spend all day  @EDI
@easyJet ..had a terrible experience yesterday...missed 7.05 am flight yesterday as i was told gates closed 25 min before , had to pay ...1)
Just realised that I'm flying with an actual airline today (BA) and not @easyJet, so my flight will actually leave on time!
@easyJet AGAIN no communication and left in the dark. Let down, yet again. Can @easyJet do anything right?
Any date @easyJet for winter schedule being released for Manchester to Bilbao or just late March?
@easyJet thanks :)
@easyJet Your bag policy and staff on the gate at Barcelona airport are an absolute disgrace. Scammed my mate for €60. #absoluteconartists
@easyJet EZY8175 You make us board and wait on the bus to the aircraft which is not ready Ground staff v unhelpful.  Are we cattle?
@easyJet thanks. That was a few hours ago now. Woken up and doing the crossword. CATNTAIL - anagram meaning 'in the ocean', perhaps?
@easyJet Hi Raquel, it's actually sorted now. We basically discovered our flights home were to the wrong airport but we've sorted a lift
@easyJet make a travel with my wife and my fourth months baby but can't be the seat next to them even if I want to pay.. Very sad!
still no reply, pls get in touch @easyJet  we need help! https://t.co/WqRx46rMDO
@easyJet what is your contact number I can't find one on the website #raging
@easyJet is there a way I can find all past bookings I've done with you? Your website only allows me to see future ones
@easyJet ...also three different reasons announced for delay?! I'm a big fan of yours, but it wasn't a good night for you! 2/2
@easyJet Thanks...problem is delay wasn't called until all had gone through boarding gate so 180 people stood on stairs or in corridor 1/2
@djanthro @Gatwick_Airport @easyJet // thanks a lot.

@easyJet I'm not bothered about a sandwich, tbh. Why does your app remove obvious info about a delayed flight after the scheduled departure?

Tened cuidado si viajáis con @easyJet. Te cobran 60€ si subes al avión con más de 1 estricto bulto. Un bolso de señora para ellos cuenta.
@katemaclean @easyJet yes! Please do, had the same problem! Had to book our own accom last night!
@easyJet Thanks for your prompt response!
@easyJet even your Twitter support is non-responsive.  Oh well par for the course.

@easyJet I should elaborate, I've been stuck here since Friday. What does easy Jet intend to do to get me home if there's another strike?
@emdmusic @easyJet good for you! The helpline does not get back to me! I've been waiting  3 days now!! Thats what they call customer service
@BecKirbyy @easyJet can let you know once we go?
@BecKirbyy @easyJet still won't let me sign in. Having to give up and head to the airport to see if there's anyone at the easyJet desk
@easyJet Is flight EZY2144 from SXF to LTN going ahead despite the strike in Berlin? Is it still 'on time' as website says?
