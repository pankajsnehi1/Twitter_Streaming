@Worldpay_UK can't seem to message you
@Worldpay_UK @QPark_UK ? Q-Parks card machine aren't working, I'm suggesting a more reliable provider may be worth looking at ie yourselves
Have to do a shout out for @Worldpay_UK customer support, absolutely superb! Always friendly, talk to someone straight away...spot on üëç
@QPark_UK 2 days running your machines at sale won't accept card payments. No signs up advising. Might be worth speaking to @Worldpay_UK
@Worldpay_UK do you guys deal with money going to and from Travelrepublic?
@Worldpay_UK It's 5 days since I tweeted about our issue and you still haven't contacted me despite passing you two different emails via DM
Excited to be out visiting customers with @kevinbibey today - let‚Äôs hope we nail some hub sales! @Worldpay_UK
