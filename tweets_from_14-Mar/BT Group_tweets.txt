@BTGroup @SkyUK but as a consolation for you losing business I'm going to send you an amazon gift voucher for £2.39 💲💲💲💲💲🤑🤑🤑
@BTGroup @SkyUK will be cancelling next month. Internet speed always poor and TV package absolute garbage. The offer of £1.39 is insulting
@BTGroup @SkyUK just got offered £1.39 compensation for up to five working days of no internet!! 😂🤣😂🤣 So far 11 months of very poor service
