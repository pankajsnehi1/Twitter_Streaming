What no nightly Cheltenham highlights on @ITV or @ITV4? Or have I missed it somewhere?
@ITV why are the 2 o'clock episodes of @JudgeRinderTV not on the ITV hub sort it out.

Loving @Baddiel @ITV #thenightlyshow #funny #funnyguy👏👏👏
@ITV @Baddiel dire
@ITV @Baddiel #a bit of dad dancing👵👵
Heavily offensive and racist @ITVNightlyShow @itv #thenightlyshow
@ITV @Baddiel worst 3rd show ever !!!
@Stu_H @ITV Sadly, we neither have the money nor the talent *sad face*
@ITV @Baddiel divina  mcall no thanks
@ITV hello your hub is a massive pile of shit, utter, utter shit
@TheTVGrump @ITV I actually thought it started off OK in the first week. It's pitiful now. Wish we could clone the American format in the UK
I could go to bed and have an early night... or I could watch Davina McCall's career dive on the horrendous #thenightlyshow on @ITV
Please can @ITV bring back @itvnews at Ten? Soon?
#NightlyShow its becoming embarrassing now, For God sake @ITV pull the plug 😱
@Baddiel You have some great moves David 🤗 #TheNightlyShow @ITVNightlyShow @ITV
📺 #Taken on #Amazon growing on me, #PTTW on @itv just silly with laughs, now "the continuation of #HellsKitchenUSA" on @itv2+1 😕
@ITV Disappointing that you have replaced the news at 10 with a talk show. Why not have that at 10.30 and leave the news where it should be
@itvracing @ITV Are there no highlights programs to watch ?
@ITV #thenightlyshow Juvenile. Amateur. Cringeworthy. Boring. As funny as haemorrhoids. PLEASE END THIS NONSENSE NOW &amp; bring back News at 10
It couldn't be any worse #NightlyShow

@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing not broadcasting last two races?!
@pussinpjs1 @AmritaAcharia1 @iJamesFloyd @ITV I've already rewatched it all, just as good &amp; emotional 2nd time round. Waiting for my dvd now
@ITV I don't understand why #TheHalcyon was cancelled, it's a great show and it's starting to gain a bigger viewership. please reconsider!!
@ITV - Links both. CNBC are an example. A magazine programme is required.  Come ITV - It's time to lead not surrender.
@takethat @ITV Oh yes! Entered 💙🎤🎶
@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing Will there be "orses"
@ITV - ITV Why have abandoned the 10'o'clock slot?  There is advertising revenue to be made - You need to be creative - You need a programme
@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing  Another event now taken over and ruined by "Tinkers" and yobs from the north. Once Horse Racing had Class.
@ITV @BroadchurchTV I wish you would shave of your beard David you a lot nicer without it
HUGE love and respect for @ThisisDavina for rescuing the sinking @ITVNightlyShow. Funny and entertaining. @ITV should be paying you more!
@loosewomen @ITV @itvracing @andrea_mclean @nadiasawalha how dare they
Looking forward to #VERA returning on @ITV this Sunday for a new 4 episodes... I don't watch many of these things but enjoy Vera

@AmpikaPickston1 @ITV I did the same thing!! Tweeted @GMB then realised I was watching +Itv felt a right plum deleted tweet though!
@ITV @TheHalcyon @MioneCorfield @mattryanreal is it true that #TheHalcyon has been axed &amp; 2nd series will not happen!?? It can't be true!!😭😭
@ITV just an observation, how come all your morning programmes are aimed at women? Very sexist!
@DanielleXo1998 @Schofe @ITV we have to watch it!!
@ITV any idea when the tv show Harlots will start? It looks really good
Good luck to the whole team of @itvracing today kicking off on @ITV today from 1pm. #CheltenhamFestival
@itvracing @ITV4 @ITV Where can we catch hi-lights of Day 1 later this evening?
James corden wants to do car pool in the uk . He would get nicked for undue care and attention here @ITV
@tinkerpuss @jongaunt Didnt you know, whilst we were sleeping they towed the British isles to North Korea? @BBC @ITV @SkyUK  never forget
@ITV @ThisisDavina It truly was awful, forced energy and not a shred of sincerity. Two previous anchors even worse...News at 10 back!
How awful is the USA presenter on @reallorraine @ITV  she's just reading and looking down 🙈 good job @Fearnecotton is amazing
@Pressparty @takethat @itvmedia @ITV my friend and I would love to go to this
@itv @studiolambert #secretchef heartwarming series continues, loving @irishsrilankan work  this series !… https://t.co/7r6VYhFAXF
@loosewomen @ITV @itvracing @CheltenhamRaces Ashamed racing isn't on all the time, the afternoons would be a better place.
@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing this is brilliant. good luck today guys
@AmpikaPickston1 @ITV are u watching on +1? I've done the same many times!! 😂
@ITV how many more episodes of #Broadchurch will there be?
@ITV your time is wrong on good morning Britain.😱I thought I had gained a extra hour !!!
@takethat @ITV @Amieee94 you know what to do.
@SportOnTheBox @ITV4 
Are there any #CheltenhamFestival highlights show on @ITV or any other channels for those who can't watch live?
@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing Love the reference to 'atmosphere' Oli ... bottle it!
@philtufnell @itv @piersmorgan remember where the loos are in Montpellier Wine Bar? I pointed you in the right direction circa 2003 ..
@Rylan @ApplauseStoreUK very excited about #Babushka this evening at @ITV studios!!
Great to see @Gemma_Chan1 on #Lorraine (minus Lorraine) @ITV  you were brilliant in #Humans
.@ITV is promoting #CheltenhamFestival this week with the release of daily #virtualreality highlights &gt; https://t.co/Ga6iaxkLH8
@Fearnecotton is the best, and most natural, stand-in presenter on @ITVLorraine; give her a regular slot @GMB @ITV! #Lorraine
Look who's joining Keith Lemon and @PaddyMcGuinness for a Ghostbusters sketch on @itv soon... https://t.co/DNpf074Ax4
@loosewomen @ITV @itvracing @CheltenhamRaces they could have put it on itv 2 and left you on missing you all 😂😘👍
@philtufnell @piersmorgan @ITV @BetBright Wash your hands afterwards... bit of a shit is Piers ...
@philtufnell @BetBright @piersmorgan @ITV might see you stumbling round the town at some point this week tuffers.
@philtufnell @piersmorgan @ITV @BetBright Careful around Piers Morgan, you might get some of the vile bigoted vitriol he vomits on your shoe
Great fun having a chat with @piersmorgan and the @ITV team about the @BetBright Cup and the next four days racing
#Cheltenham belongs in the bookies not on @itv 😡bring back #loosewomen ty x 😬
#broadchurch is brilliant! So many twists &amp; great acting! 👍🏼 @ITV
Loved @ThisisDavina on #thenightlyshow @ITV at last a bit of fun and real personality https://t.co/B46tlZUOXA

As much as I didn't think @ITV could fail when taking over the horse racing coverage from Channel 4 &amp; the @Timeform boys they're trying hard
Our shop makes a small Cameo appearance on @ITV  secret chef tonight at 8pm with local mum Lucy so tune in #surreylife #eatmorefish
@ITV Sorry to say this but [The Nightly Show] needs to be replaced by something like @NewsAtTen why change something that worked ? CRAZY
@itvracing @ITV4 @ITV C4 Morning Line had the timing right at 8am, your Opening Show is on far too late at 9.30am &amp; 10am
Dear @ITV couldn't you put the racing on ITV2, 3 or 4, which are full of repeats anyway, and leave #tippingpoint and #TheChase on ITV1?

Barely a mention of @CheltenhamRaces Festival on @BBCBreakfast this morning.
Is that because it is on @ITV ?
Asking for a friend.
@handsy4 @itvracing @ITV4 @ITV why so late will be enroute by then!# I'll be there!
@ITV @Vicky_McClure @ThisisDavina @thefattony OMG ! Davina so is trying to copy the 'Ellen' Show - Fail ! Don't bother 🤡

@ThisisDavina @ITV @BoyGeorge @Vicky_McClure it went so quickly. David Walliams I thought dragged. But most enjoyable. No more Ellen dancing
@KristinNorelius @takethat @ITV yes but then there's nothing on the website - fingers crossed it worked - good luck
