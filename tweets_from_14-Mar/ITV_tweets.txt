@AmpikaPickston1 @ITV I did the same thing!! Tweeted @GMB then realised I was watching +Itv felt a right plum deleted tweet though!
@ITV @TheHalcyon @MioneCorfield @mattryanreal is it true that #TheHalcyon has been axed &amp; 2nd series will not happen!?? It can't be true!!üò≠üò≠
@ITV just an observation, how come all your morning programmes are aimed at women? Very sexist!
@DanielleXo1998 @Schofe @ITV we have to watch it!!
@ITV any idea when the tv show Harlots will start? It looks really good
Good luck to the whole team of @itvracing today kicking off on @ITV today from 1pm. #CheltenhamFestival
@itvracing @ITV4 @ITV Where can we catch hi-lights of Day 1 later this evening?
James corden wants to do car pool in the uk . He would get nicked for undue care and attention here @ITV
@tinkerpuss @jongaunt Didnt you know, whilst we were sleeping they towed the British isles to North Korea? @BBC @ITV @SkyUK  never forget
@ITV @ThisisDavina It truly was awful, forced energy and not a shred of sincerity. Two previous anchors even worse...News at 10 back!
How awful is the USA presenter on @reallorraine @ITV  she's just reading and looking down üôà good job @Fearnecotton is amazing
@Pressparty @takethat @itvmedia @ITV my friend and I would love to go to this
@itv @studiolambert #secretchef heartwarming series continues, loving @irishsrilankan work  this series !‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7r6VYhFAXF
@loosewomen @ITV @itvracing @CheltenhamRaces Ashamed racing isn't on all the time, the afternoons would be a better place.
@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing this is brilliant. good luck today guys
@AmpikaPickston1 @ITV are u watching on +1? I've done the same many times!! üòÇ
@ITV how many more episodes of #Broadchurch will there be?
@ITV your time is wrong on good morning Britain.üò±I thought I had gained a extra hour !!!
@takethat @ITV @Amieee94 you know what to do.
@SportOnTheBox @ITV4 
Are there any #CheltenhamFestival highlights show on @ITV or any other channels for those who can't watch live?
@ITV @ITV4 @itvracing Love the reference to 'atmosphere' Oli ... bottle it!
@philtufnell @itv @piersmorgan remember where the loos are in Montpellier Wine Bar? I pointed you in the right direction circa 2003 ..
@Rylan @ApplauseStoreUK very excited about #Babushka this evening at @ITV studios!!
Great to see @Gemma_Chan1 on #Lorraine (minus Lorraine) @ITV  you were brilliant in #Humans
.@ITV is promoting #CheltenhamFestival this week with the release of daily #virtualreality highlights &gt; https://t.co/Ga6iaxkLH8
@Fearnecotton is the best, and most natural, stand-in presenter on @ITVLorraine; give her a regular slot @GMB @ITV! #Lorraine
Look who's joining Keith Lemon and @PaddyMcGuinness for a Ghostbusters sketch on @itv soon... https://t.co/DNpf074Ax4
@loosewomen @ITV @itvracing @CheltenhamRaces they could have put it on itv 2 and left you on missing you all üòÇüòòüëç

@philtufnell @BetBright @piersmorgan @ITV might see you stumbling round the town at some point this week tuffers.
@philtufnell @piersmorgan @ITV @BetBright Careful around Piers Morgan, you might get some of the vile bigoted vitriol he vomits on your shoe
Great fun having a chat with @piersmorgan and the @ITV team about the @BetBright Cup and the next four days racing
#Cheltenham belongs in the bookies not on @itv üò°bring back #loosewomen ty x üò¨
#broadchurch is brilliant! So many twists &amp; great acting! üëçüèº @ITV

As much as I didn't think @ITV could fail when taking over the horse racing coverage from Channel 4 &amp; the @Timeform boys they're trying hard
Our shop makes a small Cameo appearance on @ITV  secret chef tonight at 8pm with local mum Lucy so tune in #surreylife #eatmorefish
@ITV Sorry to say this but [The Nightly Show] needs to be replaced by something like @NewsAtTen why change something that worked ? CRAZY
@itvracing @ITV4 @ITV C4 Morning Line had the timing right at 8am, your Opening Show is on far too late at 9.30am &amp; 10am
Dear @ITV couldn't you put the racing on ITV2, 3 or 4, which are full of repeats anyway, and leave #tippingpoint and #TheChase on ITV1?

Barely a mention of @CheltenhamRaces Festival on @BBCBreakfast this morning.
Is that because it is on @ITV ?
Asking for a friend.
