@ITV Christ sake ITV, will you please just put the news back on at 10 instead of this rubbish!
@ITV Hi. Are you going to show The Americans season five at some point? Thanks.
Oh god, this is totally and utterly nauseous @ITV Do you really think people will watch that instead of @BBCNews ? totally embarrassing.
Am on @ITV +1 now, Jeezus @GordonRamsay is shite on this programme, he's still got two hands though and I thought he'd mashed one.
Bloody love #LethalWeapon on @ITV ! What a great series.
The TV show that started my whole TV career off ten years ago this year since filming with @ITV @LuckySevenPR https://t.co/HBTBwnGnQH
@GordonRamsay @ITVNightlyShow @ITV @mursmums just because YOU are a thug. Geno is in the bible. He's BRILLIANT! You? Yawn. Not Geno.
@ITV @GordonRamsay Yes matey! Bound to be hilarious #nationaltreasuretime x
@GordonRamsay @ITVNightlyShow @ITV @mursmums give Gino respect x
That's what you've been saying for 6 months. @Channel4 and @ITV manage fine. What makes @BBCiPlayer so inadequate? https://t.co/IHh1B6fSaM
@RhondaJonesLevy @ITV Indeed and with enough twists to keep you guessing to the end.
@ITV Might just be worth a watch next week then. Love @BradleyWalsh
@GordonRamsay @ITVNightlyShow @ITV @mursmums Gino is sexy. You are the same kinda prick lookalike friend. That my ex died from. Gino respect

@ITV @GordonRamsay @johnlegend @AidanGardner__ peas lol imagine if it was scampi mate 😂😂😂
This #NightlyShow shit just isn't working is it @ITV? Bring back the news, as depressing as it is right now. 😒
@ITV spend untold money and hours creating #nightlyshow whilst #thelastleg is just consistently knocking it out of the park on @Channel4
@GordonRamsay I hate Mushy Peas so much @ITV
@itv thinking bullying is good @Ofcom on #thenightlyshow well it isn't but I guess that's how immature tv is now
May just have to watch the #thenightlyshow next week love #BradleyWalsh @ITV
@ITV when you going to call it a day with this nightly show it's sooo shit 😫
@ITV @GordonRamsay @johnlegend No offence ITV you should realise this is a bad show. ALOT of people don't like it
@anazapta555 @thevoiceuk @ITV I agree.
@RachelM_85 @thevoiceuk @ITV @imjustcalledmo Yes!!
@ITV @GordonRamsay @johnlegend Who fucking gives a fuck. It's Friday night it's pay day let's get of our tits 😂😂🙈🙈
@kellynelsonuk @thevoiceuk @ITV @imjustcalledmo Yes!!!!!
@wendyerose @thevoiceuk @ITV I agree!!! The show is called THE VOICE.. and mo has the best voice this year without a doubt.
Watching Agatha Christie on @ITV  with Grandad and @George_Osborne pops up. There is no end to his talents 😅🙃 https://t.co/mJdqALWeWX
Watched #thenightlyshow for around 1 min. Full of totally unnecessary gratuitous bad language. Switched over to @BBCNews. Very poor @ITV
another great episode of #LethalWeapon @ITV
@thevoiceuk @ITV @imjustcalledmo 👌
@ITVNightlyShow @GordonRamsay @BradleyWalsh @johnlegend @ITV John watched John Legends new album with Gordon sooo funny brilliant😂😂😂
@Itv @GordonRamsay  oh dear 😞 Gordon Ramsay show is a new low - shame on you.
#NightlyShow Gordon Ramsey has made this show, from the TWATS who went before. WORTH FUCKIN' WATCHING YOU @ITV twats!
@GordonRamsay @ITV  #thenightlyshow - total drivel, scripted, unfunny, dross. Embarrassing that's it's on mainstream TV.
I love @johnlegend 's music #TheNightlyShow @ITVNightlyShow @ITV @GordonRamsay
@ITV i would like to make a complaint
Just caught a few minutes of #thenightlyshow and can see why it's been panned #puerile #notfunny @ITV
@ITVNightlyShow @BradleyWalsh @GordonRamsay @ITV Should be the last time ever...terrible show.
@iam_jlc The powers that be at @ITV need to make this happen
@ITV oooh please get Riggs !!💋💋💋
@GordonRamsay @ITV  Gordon Ramsey on @nightlyshow  just #brilliant. From chef to presenter.
