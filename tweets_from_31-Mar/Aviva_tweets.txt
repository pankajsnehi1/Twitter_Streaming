@avivaUK why??????
@avivaUK or I could phone them. Have you tried phoning a bank lately?
@avivaUK my bank is miles away, so I have to do this for your internal rules, it's not even regulatory. Can I bill you for the bus fare?
@avivaUK or I have to go to my bank and get a letter from them showing the details that I have just given you on the application form. Why?
@avivaUK  or a cancelled cheque. Or a paying in slip. Are you kidding?
@avivaUK so to cash in my pension pot I have to show you a paper bank statement? I haven't had one of those since last century.
If there is anything you do in life do not insure any of your cars or vans with @AvivaUK complete rinse you for any changed of vehicles ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

@AvivaUK won't accept claim for theft from car unless bodywork as well as glass is damaged. Nowhere in the policy document. Sharp practice.
