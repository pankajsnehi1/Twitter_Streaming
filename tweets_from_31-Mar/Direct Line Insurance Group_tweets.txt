@DirectLine_UK You made my day Paddy. Thank you.
@kayjay0404 @DirectLine_UK They are rubbish!! I too left them after putting mine up and not matching. Saved loads

Thank you so much to @DirectLine_UK for recovering me and my car and taking me home from Birmingham to London! Fab customer service!!
@DirectLine_UK What's the point. Morons making ridiculous rules. Not directed at your amy. Your only doing your job.
@DirectLine_UK  ago .. and I told I had sent this back too as I left in my cool off period .. little bit annoyed!
@DirectLine_UK Hi, I have had an email from yourselves regarding sending back my telematics device .. which I already have over a year ..

Very short sighted of @DirectLine_UK to not price match competitors on car insurance. I've just saved myself nearly £200!
