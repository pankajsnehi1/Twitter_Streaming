@SkyUK if your phone signal is as good as your broadband I'll give it a miss 😤

What impression is Tom Hardy doing on the new Sky advert ? @SkyUK @tomhardyup
@leeormrod @SkyUK Mine is doing same and has been for last few days. So fed up
Oh god the new @SkyUK advert, thank u so much for blessing my tv screen with that beautiful man
@angel_tasha67 @SkyUK Guess you like him lol
Friday night. 24 movie channels and the best they've got for me is free willy? Free bastard willy? 😩

@SnatchHQ looks like we're cancelling @SkyUK for a few months. Same company though 😁 https://t.co/aoDxWetsBU
@SkyUK  what crap service your installation engineers give..leave 80 year olds to set up the TV  no phone working ,you should be ashamed
Another night that I weep at my stupidity for giving @SkyUK £100 / month of my life savings #5millonchannelsofcrap
@SkyUK .

I would never recommend anyone to sign up with Sky. Absolutely livid with the service and customer service they have provided.
Another day of below par customer service from @SkyUK, on hold for 40 mins yesterday and no call back today when promised #timetotryvirgin
Sky go is fucking rubbish. No longer works on firefox, google chrome or microsoft edge. Missed entire first half of rugby now ✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼 @SkyUK
@SkyUK I'm so sorry I left to go to @virginmedia having used their system for 2 days I know I did bad, have me back in 1 year?
@SkyUK loving the #TomHardy advert ❤️
Whoever is on the backshift get emmerdale uploaded to on demand the now @SkyUK @ITV @WeAreSTV
#TomHardy advertising what again!?!? Was too transfixed on his beautiful face to notice 😉 @SkyUK #skymobile
@SkyUK skyQ broke again. What a load of bollocks
Me and my mum both left @SkyUK TV 
Now they offer mobile but it's too late, I already get rollback with @Virgin and after ditching @ThreeUK
Very clever @SkyUK #TomHardy has now made me want sugar lumps in my pockets! 😁
Just seen the new @SkyUK mobile advert....don't know why but I'm now tempted to get one 😉😂 #TomHardy
So @EE will you be introducing rollover data, minutes and texts like @SkyUK Mobile do??
@EE so @SkyUK can let you roll over unused data...What are you going to offer?
Thanks @SkyUK for blessing my TV screen with Tom Hardy.
Well that #skymobile ad made my night I little better.. Tom Hardy 😍 good choice @SkyUK .. very good choice 😍😍
@SkyUK box broken for a month, can't get through - reset box 3 times on phone, cut off x2, 30 min wait on Mon, no luck on live chat. Help!
@peter_stephens @SkyUK Agreed! Reward new customers and not existing. My wifi is crap too. Its the cheap ass routers they send
@SkyUK want to watch Moana on Sky Store but, surprise surprise, no subtitles for your deaf customers. Sort it out, Sky, it's 2017!
@SkyUK just rented Arrival from Sky Store and the sound keeps cutting out for a few seconds at a time. Can you fix?
The new advert with #TomHardy on @SkyUK is hot though 😍
Just finished the final episode of @Revenge on @SkyUK.
We'll miss you @EmilyVanCamp, @Gabriel_Mann &amp; @Nick_Wechsler.
Thankyou ❤❤❤
@SkyNews @SkyUK getting completely ridiculous time to end the subscription.
@SkyUK - "current download speed 0.9Mbps" "no issues detected with your connection" so glad we pay a fortune for medieval speeds
@BTCare nope, your broadband is too expensive, we have @SkyUK

@SkyUK Srª boa tarde toda programação Sky é HD?
@SkyUK Hi,I don't suppose you could suggest a reason why my internet disappears at 7pm every night
A Friday night with no broadband is soul destroying. It's my film and pamper night to myself... come on @SkyUK don't want to wait til 00:00
@SkyUK your customer care is so poor. No satellite signal and 6 days for an engineer. Pathetic and no one calls back when they say they will
My @SkyUK Q box keeps freezing 😡
@Obadigie @SkyUK Yup same here! After 'move your router' even tho i was 5ft from it
@peter_stephens @SkyUK Had the same problem with @SkyUK they told me to upgrade to Sky Q unreal
@SkyUK Hi, what's wrong with your website, live chat and telephone line?! Can't get through and need to speak with someone about my package!

OK, so latest please return letter on the doorstep from @SkyUK is same package for £19pm Vs £72pm. Why not just be transparent at first call

@SkyUK your internet is shit, u scammed us🖕
@aarongiles1985 @SkyUK @bt_uk @virginmedia Got 2 of their new boxes and the high end broadband box too
@SkyUK customer service is literally the shittest I've ever experienced
@lennysaints @SkyUK @bt_uk @virginmedia That's not bad considering. Had virgin broadband at an old address and it's the best I've ever used
.@SkyUK And then try to charge me for a new router?! So there is a problem, you just want EVEN more money for it?! Extortion
@aarongiles1985 @SkyUK @bt_uk @virginmedia I've just signed up. £80 a month for everything
49 mins on the phone to @SkyUK and they tell me to pay for a new router 'because wifi is just a feature'. Terrible service.
@lennysaints @SkyUK @bt_uk @virginmedia Seriously considering the switch myself. Sky broadband is awful!
@SkyUK just spent 45 mins on hold to home move. Transferred to manager to agree deal. Home team now absent so cannot complete. Bad service!
Bye bye @SkyUK @bt_uk hello @virginmedia
@SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam staff even had the audacity to put the phone down on me and my husband when I complained!
@SkyUK are quick to install and take your money - customer for 3 days and now 3 weeks to get an engineer fix an issue?? Absolute joke.
@SkyUK your service is a joke, communication between staff and customers is also a joke
@SkyUK bring back entourage now please, thank you @mrdougellin

Not happy @virginmedia totally rude advisor on phone 'we're not matching @SkyUK ' and hung up. Will be moving my custom asap
@kelly_welles @DeborahFW @bishakali @SkyUK @TigerAspectUK Yurp, I second that.
@SkyUK absolute disgusting install today at my 70yo mother inlaws house.  Sky do not care and customer service is appalling.
Again unacceptably slow speeds from @virginmedia might be time to switch to @SkyUK
@SkyUK Who needs a new phone every year?
@LadyNadiaEssex @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam I know the feeling you pay more for nothing

Never in my life have I had such bad customer service.. 80 mins on phone and through to 5 people in total .. #cancelled!!! @SkyUK #joke
@SkyUK just cancelled! Fed up of paying high prices compared to others. You weren't bothered about keeping me as a customer either.
@SkyUK why can't I make the sky q box play something from my app on the iPhone? Downgraded a vital feature: sky go works as a remote!
@SkyUK My iPhone 7 is on the way !!! 😁

@SkyUK Not exactly working towards the Sustainable Development Goals are you. You should encourage responsible consumption of resources.
It is simply outrageous the lack of help from your team to resolve this matter. #virginfailedme @virginmedia time to call sky.! @SkyUK
Cancelled @SkyUK today. Put through to retentions and not so much as an offer to stay . Think I have made the right call. Cheerio!
@SkyUK the girl promoting complimentary phone cases at Waterloo station is fab! That job isn't easy but she's doing SUCH a cracking job!
@LadyNadiaEssex @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam Should of gone wiv virgin media !!!
@SkyUK any idea why only sky news will load and play on sky go? No other channel will load. 'Error has occurred'
Terrible service from @SkyUK
@Colonelblighty @flippper1 That's something I might do if I leave @SkyUK before then
No reply from the @SkyHelpTeam, that's not very helpful! @SkyUK  answer the phone straight away when you say you're leaving!!
@SkyUK why is my internet not working? I need to use my laptop for internet for something urgent and I can't!
@SkyUK shocking service spent two hours on trying to sort out moving home and take your service now can't wait to cancel @virginmedia

@SkyUK you're Sky Q product is a joke. Too many flaws in it, was it ever beta tested in more than one environment?
@smartin @SkyUK It really is. You do have to go through a lot of crap freebies before something decent comes along tho 😀
@Andrew_K_Wilson @SkyUK Waterloo's a magnet for marketers: the other day I got free cat food. Delicious.

Gotta be up again by 2pm. @SkyUK are calling to update me on their massive cock-up. Not gonna hold my breath while I wait though! #useless
.@SkyUK Not even bothered are you! Then guess what here is a potential customer that can't be bothered either!
@SkyUK can we have a league of their own series 1-7 on box set or even purchase on DVD ?
