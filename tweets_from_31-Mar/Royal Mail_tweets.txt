@RoyalMail @SJCooke94 Sam has not made a complaint and is very understanding. The postie is going to knock on and apologise in person.
@bantercards @RoyalMail You're amazing THANK YOU 😘 new favourite company!
@RoyalMail @SJCooke94 Don't give the postie a hard time he was trying to do Sam a favour!
@RoyalMail @SJCooke94 That postie deserves a raise. Frankly anything is better than having to go to the bloody collections office.

@Ian_norvic @USPS @RoyalMail Thanks for sharing, @Ian_norvic.
@RoyalMail the package. Doesn't make it ok that employees do this once a week because they refuse to carry flippin post. How do I complain?
@mhack @RoyalMail #guyswhosignforthings 😍🔥
@RoyalMail how can I contact my local depot about where my parcel is?
@RoyalMail took it because it's "too wet". I tried to make a complaint but got shrugged and walked away mid writing because they found

@RoyalMail sent an item 2 months ago, seller missed the item &amp; didn't rebook. Says it was being returned to me but it never arrived back?
@RoyalMail Callers are paying up to 60p per minute just so you can get about 2p per minute in revenue share payments. Crazy!
@RoyalMail can you stop ignoring me
@GeniLovelock @RoyalMail You're more than welcome Genevieve, pleased we were able to help!
@parcelforce I've tried that, @RoyalMail keep telling me they have no info. Who else could help me?

What's the point of paying £9 for Special Next Day Delivery when postman doesn't even ring bell! So annoying @RoyalMail
@RoyalMail Well... Having been assured that the van was long gone &amp; no possible re-delivery attempt could be made for 3 days...
