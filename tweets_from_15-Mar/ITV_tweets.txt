Well done @ITV your disastrous #NightlyShow project has really worked to beat @BBCNews @ 10. I just switched to it for 1st time in many yrs!
Dear God; even by normal @ITV standards, the #Nightly show is rubbish. I wish I could unsee it.
This is truly the worst trash I've seen on @ITV Whoever is responsible should never be allowed to work in media again #thenightlyshow
The best thing shown on #Benidorm is the Clean #FishTank in Neptunes bar @ITV

@ITV pulse can we get news back on at 10 and consign that nightly show to the dustbin of obscurity
@ITV @Baddiel 😄😄😄. True.
@Gatz77 @fyooE5 @Daniel_Hatch @GMB @ITV It's a disgrace, I think he's worse than @KTHopkins and that says a lot
@jwbirch @fyooE5 @Daniel_Hatch @GMB @ITV they keep him on because like right now he gets headlines and publicity for being a cunt.
@fyooE5 @Daniel_Hatch @GMB That's an understatement. I don't get how @ITV keep him on when everyone detests him

@takethat @ITV @GaryBarlow wish me luck 🍀
@iJamesFloyd @ITV  Fantastic 😄 I cannot wait!
@ITV what about cancer patients wearing scarfs? It's all about dignity. Some Jewish people wear scarfs
"It's not your show" how arrogant &amp; rude you were when yr guest was trying 2 explain #piersmorgan @ITV - - get a better host! SWITCHED OVER!
"It's not your show" @piersmorgan no you're right, it's our show so shut up and let your guests speak @ITV @GMB
@ITV how on earth do you still have @piersmorgan  on your morning show? He is so infuriating! I've switched off!
@TVKev Axe the awful @ITVNightlyShow show and reinstate @NewsAtTen, @ITV! #BringBackNewsAtTen #ITV #itvnews #TheNightlyShow
