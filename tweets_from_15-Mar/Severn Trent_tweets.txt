@Midnight_Wuff @stwater Reminds me of when I lived in Tower District, couldn't use tap water for coffee, tasted like blood.
@stwater Any news on the water leak Old Neighbourhood Hill Stroud, leaking for over three weeks now, any news on when it's getting fixed ?
Ack, when coffee tastes metallic, you know that something is very wrong somewhere.  @stwater messing with the fecking supply again?  O.O

@stwater why not encourage the use of #electric #cars as company vehicles? Hire a #Tesla from @EVision_EVRent &amp; have zero emissions!
@Sarahhales1993 I'll pass this on to our highways team to look into, in case they're not aware. @stwater @MyNottingham @broxtowebc
@stwater Hi, there is some work to fix a noisy manhole cover outside my home due - could you update on when it's likely to be carried out?
@stwater when you dig a hole do you fill it in the same day. Your guys told me my water was back on and then left https://t.co/mnBYe09O1W
@Sarahhales1993 Hi, you will need to contact @stwater and the highways authority of either @MyNottingham or @Nottscc depending on location.
@stwater Thank you, DM sent..
@stwater You keep texting me about bill payments &amp; water problems but i’m not your customer or even live in your area, how can i stop it?
