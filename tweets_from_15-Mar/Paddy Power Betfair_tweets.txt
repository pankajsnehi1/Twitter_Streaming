@NevsFootyNaps @paddypower @AskPaddyPower Bakayoko , silva , mendy , possibly mbappe

@paddypower he didn't fool the ref. If the ref thought it was a headbutt he'd have given him a red, it was a yellow to each, which was right
@paddypower What odds would for @WaverleyBC returning my bin back to my house on collection days? #farnham
@Brian19th @paddypower it's a fake u scoundrel

@andypops @paddypower I played by the rules, Andy.
@bruts80 @paddypower it wasn't a fix mate. Horse wasn't right and wasn't happy jumping.
@Brian19th @paddypower that's a fake tweet Paddy don't give him a free bet
