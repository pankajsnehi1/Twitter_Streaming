@BTGroup @rioferdy5 @wef Great choice.  And by the way, awesome interview Rio with Mr Floyd Mayweather.  Relaxed and intimate. #Style.
This is so disgusting, I hope he's fired @BTCare @bt_uk @BTGroup https://t.co/wlLfuL8GzT
@bt_uk @BTGroup @SkyUK cant go back coz @BT ceased my line..not impressed at all considering am still paying for it.
Slow speeds for @bt_uk @BTGroup @SkyUK was way better going backüò°üò°üò°üò°
@T_skll @rioferdy5 @wef @BTGroup it could do well. Kids opinions would work
@BTGroup openreach says fibre orders taken for ALL our neighbours yet we are still in scope despite living in the middle of them all. Why?
@RobbieSavage8 @BTGroup @EE Fab you liked our idea! Setting up an ASD Football Academy would be awesome! Maybe you can come to open it?
@RobbieSavage8 @BTGroup @EE Hope you enjoyed your food and drink mate. And your Welsh spoon!!!
@RobbieSavage8 @BTGroup @EE it was a fun day indeed.  I am now tucking into more Welshcakes in my hotel.  Safe home!
@BTGroup Do us a favour use traffic management which works and ask your men in vans not to park on verges, chaos today in #holymoorside S42
@T_skll @rioferdy5 @wef @BTGroup YES!
@rioferdy5 @wef @BTGroup Good for you Rio. Proper chuffed. I'd like to see you present MOTD and let your kids in the studio for views
@rioferdy5 @wef @BTGroup Congrats Rio

RBFS TEAM @MarkJopling @BTGroup actively participating in #Dads4Daughters Have you taken the unconscious bias test?‚Ä¶ https://t.co/hj6sB3YWxz
@BTGroup Someone?? Still awaiting reply from 2013 when I finally left @bt to join @virgin. on a separate issue. Won't hold my breath !
@BTGroup working implies action but the plan isn't in design phase. Thus inaction is a more accurate description of current state of "work"!
@BTCare @virginmedia Virgin do their job properly, @BTGroup  don't! Stop passing the buck &amp; someone respond to my logged complaint please!
@BTGroup so no ETA whatsoever, thus I question the "working hard" claim! Hell its not even the design phase! https://t.co/gsJjglyvYy
@BTGroup openreach complaint logged C1543439, you've sent subcontractors to dig under my foundations in breach of party wall act.
@BTGroup @BTCare That's great, I'll donate some money to @rednoseday  if someone at #openreach can be bothered to do their job !
@BTGroup do you have a timescale for how quick this hard work will fill that 5%?
@BTGroup @BTCare maybe they should spend a little more time dealing with customer complaints &amp; issues first?
