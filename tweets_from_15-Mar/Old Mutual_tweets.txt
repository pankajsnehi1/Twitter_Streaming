@OldMutualSA the point I'm making from a #cx point of view, is that it should be easier for your customers. #suggestion #feedback
@OldMutualSA I'm on my way to fax the documents now after liaising with your call centre and sending via email to them &amp; to processing dept.
Because apparently email is too much of a challenge @sure_kamhunga @OldMutualSA
Right?! @dlawre30 I'm a little dumbfounded... @OldMutualSA
@GoSocialSA @OldMutualSA fax? in this day and age?
@GoSocialSA @OldMutualSA Crazy nobody uses a fax anymore
It's not exactly what I call efficiency or making it easy on the customer @OldMutualSA #notimpressed #muchfrustration
Come on @OldMutualSA - I send documents via email and your processing department can't receive the file sizes (3MB) so I'm asked to pls fax?
