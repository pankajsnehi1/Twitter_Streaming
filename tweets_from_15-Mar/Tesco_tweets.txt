@Tesco No disappointment. Kids loved it and thought it was fun to try and put them together like a puzzle. But will dm you anyway
@Tesco so no intelligence involved. Just monkeys paid peanuts.
And upon checking my @Tesco receipt I discover yet AGAIN I have been overcharged. Do not shop at TESCO! Not by a few pennies either, £7.50!!

@tesco insert card but card reader does not, causing POS to say card read error or contactless to fail. Multiple times multiple tills. 3/3

@tesco recognise the PQ code as a payment code, beeps but throws an error. Then trying to pay with card or contactless, system says 2/3
@Tesco Possible issue in your self service checkouts - this has happened multiple times. Try to pay with PayQwik. System seems not to 1/3
@ReevesHall there are many @Tesco stores that have poor walking and cycling access. Many other large supermarkets with the same issue.
