@MAB_Updates How much commission did/does @landg_uk pay you to lie to your customers?
You've fraudulently made a couple of grand off me.
@landg_uk Hi, I'm trying to take out a policy &amp; unable to as your system is down. When do you expect it to be up and running again?
@MABNorthwest How much commission did/does @landg_uk pay you to lie to your customers?
@landg_uk It's in the hands of the Ombudsmen now. No point in me wasting more time making a complaint about staff. Nothing will be done.
@landg_uk You are without doubt the rudest, most condescending company I've ever dealt with and I've dealt with some terrible companies.
@landg_uk why not encourage the use of #electric #cars as company vehicles? Hire a #Tesla from @EVision_EVRent &amp; have zero emissions!

@landg_uk great. Many thanks.
@landg_uk thanks. I will re email it now. My insurance ran out yesterday so it's important.
Morning @landg_uk I've sent 2 emails regarding my renewal insurance and not had one reply! Do you not reply to mails? Last resort is Twitter
