@virginmedia do you have any other offers for previous customers looking to return? As @SkyUK have offered me a great offer to stay.
@ArsenalAndrew @SkyFootball @SkyUK @btsportfootball is crap too. Painfully poor. Both I think have recently raised their prices too.
@SkyUK just when you think the service can't get any worse, a planned call back from a manager doesn't materialise!!  Well done team sky!
@DelmeJ I'm so sick of state of @SkyFootball commentary teams I can't stand to pay them any more. Sorry @SkyUK you need to raise your game.
@ArsenalAndrew @SkyUK Don't they make it SO easy to add stuff though 😉😂
So @SkyUK are total rip off! It's daylight robbery the amount they want to charge my mum for a variety pack! Ridiculous
