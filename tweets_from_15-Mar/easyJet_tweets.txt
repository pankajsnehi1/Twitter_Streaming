@easyJet . Sirs, is it below their dignity for your Facebook social media team to answer baggage questions?
@easyJet Hi, I was on flight EZY8943 in seat 7F on 11/3/17. wondering if you found a blue kindle in the seat pocket of 7F or 7E?
Many thanks

@easyJet I'm really unhappy that I have had to miss out on my holiday due to your staff refusing my boyfriends passport on Monday
@easyJet Your CEO wrote to me promising a call about a refund... a month on, no call. Disappointing. Thought she was a woman of her word

@easyJet thanks easyJet for charging my wife for 1kg excess baggage after she's spent two days stranded in UK because of Berlin strikes.
@KentGerman @easyJet My mum did something a bit like that on Concorde. Not sure that you can get up to Mach 2 by Brighton though
@KentGerman @easyJet Great! Nice trip as far as the Brighton coast and back again.
I never knew there was an actual course. Well done @easyJet üôå https://t.co/KitBJB9Hl4

Bon @easyJet je compte sur toi. Deconne pas gros.
#easyjet uses depletion tactics when it comes to reimbursements. @easyJet , I'm still waiting for a solution for my flight 10 months ago.
@easyJet good morning. I need to complain about a late bus from Easy Bus. Can you help me and tell which email address should I mail to?
@mouldycake @GMB @easyJet @FearlessFlyer99 people should get over their fear of dying .once you've conquered that then there's no problems

At Gatwick and there's an @easyJet flight on the board to...Gatwick? https://t.co/L90vwdRDpn
.@FlyingBrussels is it so complicated to allow check-in when you buy the ticket and not *24h* only before flight. You know, like @easyJet?

@AlsaC0ffeeRider @easyJet oui trop cher. &amp; surtout j'aime pas quand on affiche un prix &amp; qu'une fois que tu es pr√™t √† payer le prix augmente
@easyJet why allow passengers to board the Glasgow to Gatwick just to sit for an hour delayed.
@easyJet hi there! I'm flying from Manch Tot Ams tonight. How can I arrange speedy boarding that after checking in?

@RuggedChloe @easyJet  trop cher ? :/
Have to say. The baggage drop off at @Gatwick_Airport for @easyJet was fantastic. Totally idiot proof which is essential at 4am.
@easyJet You still don't get it never mind. I will send you a picture next time.
@easyJet are you able to confirm a flight booking? i am getting the error [ej2 exception] and leave tomorrow. urgent.
Having flown with both @Monarch and @easyJet the biggest difference for me was the cabin crew. EJ happy + helpful, Monarch grumpy and rude!
@easyJet can I put eliquid in my hold luggage? Flying to Bulgaria with you on guys on Thursday. #TPD2017 #vapesafety #vapesonaplane
