@AskLloydsBank I just direct messaged you
@AskLloydsBank Hi. Are you meant to receive an activation code, for online banking?
@AskLloydsBank Glassdoor I believe üòÅ
@AskLloydsBank When setting up an account with Lloyds will i recieve my bank details in the appointment or later (&amp; do I have to ask them)
@AskLloydsBank I did. It fine. üëçüèª
@yourownplace @PAPERCIC @remadedinburgh @urbangrowthlg loved seeing you amazing guys catch up again soon. Thanks‚Ä¶ https://t.co/LlN6yton77
@AskLloydsBank I have a feeling you may have missed the point. Check out the weekly wage you are offering üëç
@AskLloydsBank 1 doesn't  give option for cash. One gave card back w/out dispensing money (no error messages). Just thought I'd report themüòä
@AskLloydsBank - how do I apply? Not a bad weekly wage either üòò https://t.co/8GLop9JeQ1
@AskLloydsBank Hi, Newland Avenue (Hull), 2/3 ATMs outside of branch not working.
@AskLloydsBank Everyone says this is unacceptable service. Catalogue of errors. But no one solves it. I want access to MY money!!!
@AskLloydsBank ...Was on phone so left message. Rang again 7.40 to be told he had left at 6 which is when he finishes. Appalled
@AskLloydsBank He was supposed to call at 6 tonight on his suggestion as he wasn't working yesterday. I rang at 6.30 and was told he...
@AskLloydsBank I have demanded a phone call tomorrow morning from the manager of the complaints manager who was supposed to own this.
@AskLloydsBank I will also be emailing your CEO with full timeline of this farce.
@AskLloydsBank The constant "I'm sorry", "i understand" is not acceptable after this length of time. I've demanded a call tomorrow morning
@AskLloydsBank I have been misled, lied to, passed around, but no one solves the problem. Customer service and resolution is a joke.
@AskLloydsBank I am now beyond frustrated. I am angry. I was supposed to get a call today from complaints manager. Guess what? No call
@PHammondMP sells off its share in @AskLloydsBank paid for in #austerity yet slashes #PIPs for mentally ill. W.@Conservatives its lose-lose
@AskLloydsBank thanks! What time does it close?
@AskLloydsBank hi I have a student credit car that I don't use. How do I close the account. Thanks
@AskLloydsBank It's ok, it makes a funny story! I've given up for tonight cos there's only so much trauma a guy can take. Until tomorrow!
