Just blocked @DirectLine_UK as they are low-life morons. 😡
@DaveWallsworth @DirectLine_UK 

Lol. Bit gimmicky. Just like @BritishGasHelp giving free leccy on Sat/Sun.
@DirectLine_UK Amazing service. DL arranged pick up of my damaged car, a hire car for me and my car was fixed and back in 8 days!
Why is @DirectLine_UK spending so much on advertising insurance for tenants missing rent payments? https://t.co/RlWnldsLfS
@mattstannard @DirectLine_UK Not a lot!
@DaveWallsworth @DirectLine_UK hehe how much Jet A1 would that get you?
@DirectLine_UK I have done, thank you
@DirectLine_UK Been with you 2/3 years now, no claims discount and you want to put my monthly fee up by £20? You must be kidding!
@DirectLine_UK all done :-)
@DirectLine_UK big thank you to your professional and friendly staff mark (policy renewal) and James in accounts. #greatservice
@DirectLine_UK how can I cancel my h/ins policy? Unable to call ATM and cannot find my policy number
@DirectLine_UK Is this a feature you'd be able to offer at all? Thanks :) (2)
@DirectLine_UK Hi, I've noticed a feature on virgin media's travel insurance where you can pay an additional fee &amp; then pay no excess. (1)
@DirectLine_UK Thats an hour of my life I won’t get back! This is so much hassle we will be looking to change provider at renewal.
So, we have @DirectLine_UK policy which includes courtesy car, but we have to deal with a third party and THEY have to claim costs? Really?
@DaveWallsworth @DirectLine_UK If that's your cashback what the hell is your premium ???
@DirectLine_UK a week after my accident nothing has happened, no parts ordered, car still in same place gathering dust, not renewing again
@DaveWallsworth @oliwalkerjones @DirectLine_UK just make sure the app isn't on when you're flying? 😉
@dsk4567 @DirectLine_UK Just like Superman, I never drink when I fly! (Or drive!) 😄✈️
@DaveWallsworth @DirectLine_UK not even two pints !
@DirectLine_UK I will indeed! Hopefully you take all this into account when calculating renewal premiums! 😉
@oliwalkerjones @DirectLine_UK Yes. It uses an app on the phone called DrivePlus to measure each journey using GPS. Clever! 😄🚘

@DaveWallsworth @DirectLine_UK Cool - is that based on analysis of your actual driving? Like speed, braking, G-force?
When you do 600mph plus every day at work you don't feel the need to rush around when driving! Thanks for another m… https://t.co/9t3bUq91ql

@DirectLine_UK if a customer knowingly gets an 'unqualified' gas engineer to install a boiler in their home would you still insure property?
@DirectLine_UK, Seems my road is 'risky'.  Check how my every journey starts with a &lt;20 point penalty. #FeelsBadMan https://t.co/WMwjrZAO2D
