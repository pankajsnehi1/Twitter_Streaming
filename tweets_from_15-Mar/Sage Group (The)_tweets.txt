@sageuk P60s must be given to your employees by 31 May. Employees who leave before 5 April don't need a P60 from you #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk If you notice before 19 April rollback, correct &amp; submit FPS adjustment. If after 19 April submit EYU after correcting #sageadvice
@sageuk You don‚Äôt need to take them off hold but you can clear the On Hold check box in Criteria #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk That's right. If leave date was on or before 5 April the P45 for Month 1 wouldn't print #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk No there's no need. The tax code is based on the date the employee is paid, not what dates they're being paid for #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk Yes you can. HMRC will accept your latest submission as long as sent by 19th April #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk You can process &amp; submit year end as soon as you've updated &amp; submitted the final pay period in 16/17 #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk You can use Advance Pay for holidays over year end but not statutory payments, info at: https://t.co/XRH7FtBqPg #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk Yes you can, as long as you‚Äôve ran &amp; submitted all of your payroll for the 16/17 tax year #sageadvice #PYE
@sageuk Yes, you can send EPS once you‚Äôve submitted last FPS. Once EPS submitted, run year end &amp; submit end of year EPS #sageadvice #PYE
