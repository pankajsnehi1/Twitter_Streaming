@GSK first we need to sort out education especially maths (and I don't mean arithmetic)
@GSK This was due to an unforeseen accident in time travel research. The Department of Temporal Investigations are looking into the problem.
@spoilpartygames @GSK think science is useful in all ages
@zimviv @GSK wrong to exoect all 11 yr olds to perform the same especially from poorer backgrounds. Properly funded and staffed secondaries
@zimviv @GSK no way! Fund schools properly and make uni cheaper! I am a teacher grammar schools at the expense of other schools (budgets)
@GSK it will be short of docs, nurses, teachers and far more too.
Learn from other industries! Unique case study with @GSK at 14:45! #CTSEurope17
