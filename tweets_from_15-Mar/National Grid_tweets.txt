@nationalgriduk you need to sort out Canal street as soon as possible.
@nationalgriduk @MyNottingham this has been a shocking project from the start. More than 6 months of digging with no end in sight
@nationalgriduk @MyNottingham would be much quicker if there was actual work being done!! 1505 today https://t.co/ReV9BQykYT
@nationalgriduk @MyNottingham seeing as you first dug up road in July, what's a couple more days for fed up residents to suffer??! ðŸ¤”
@sommecourt @IoTchannel @pzfreo @nationalgriduk Soz. I think we are done anyway. :-)
@IoTchannel @Nick_SMHS @pzfreo @nationalgriduk guys can you untag me from this please.
