@unitedutilities are you dropping off water for everyone? Still not a drop out the tap in Argyle Street WA10
@unitedutilities just had some water delivered which is much appreciated. Any idea of when the water supply is likely to be back on?

@unitedutilities been looking at tweets and everyone should be a priority as water IS a priority in every household!
@unitedutilities it's actually more insulting than not answering it at all
@unitedutilities thanks for not answering the question 😕
@errolthin @unitedutilities Hi, Someone has put on that Standish St has a tanker available to collect water from. Don't know if this is true
