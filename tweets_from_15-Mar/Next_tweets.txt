@nextofficial amazing give away
@nextofficial they did, they gave me a refund card but I can't redeem it. I don't c why it's an issue to pay it off my directory account.
@nextofficial, you should have used “store should['ve] resolved” instead. ‘Have’ is a real verb.
@nextofficial it was a while ago &amp; i had no receipt as 18s always fit I didn't try on. Now have money on a card I cant use so yes bit unfair
@nextofficial Wow! I love these, they're fabulous xx😍😍😍
@nextofficial it does but in this case, it wasn't my fault. Ordered loads of clothes is size 18, got a top out and you had sent me a size 8
