@stoughton_p Yes, it belonged to @DiageoGB and they were selling it. They halved the sale price &amp; various agencies raised the money.
@BBC_Joe_Lynam @DiageoGB shocking.  Arthur be turning in his grave
@BBC_Joe_Lynam @DiageoGB Sadly, in my experience,  that's par for the course in GB.
@BBC_Joe_Lynam @DiageoGB Even at its best, I don't put her down as a Guinness drinker...
@BBC_Joe_Lynam @DiageoGB FFS, that's minging. Paul Ryan's 'pint' is also awful.

The Guinness Bar which we provided for ITV this morning is ALL OVER todays online papers! Happy St Patricks Day ! @Diageo_News @DiageoGB
Considering how much the people of Scotland have given to @DiageoGB over the years the Monarch of the Glen should have been gifted. £4m? 🤔

@cyrus2psx @DiageoGB that's a STAGgering comment
They might have reduced the selling price but did @DiageoGB profit from this sale? https://t.co/sCIv17ZA1j
