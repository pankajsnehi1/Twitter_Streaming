@easyJet are they going to be entitled to compensation? They were only staying for 36 hours in the first place &amp; is a massive inconvenience
@easyJet hi my parents have just had their flight diverted from Vienna from Bristol to Gatwick and they still have to travel to Plymouth..
@easyJet I've heard that 3 times and it does not explain what I experienced, but understand that it is your job to pretend it does.
Passionate about making travel easy and affordable... then why hike your price up from £250 return to nearly £700 in one day @easyJet 😡
@TLRailUK between you and @easyJet you really know how to take the edge off the end of a holiday!
When you realise you haven't added a suitcase to your flight like 2 days before you travel 🙈 @easyJet #helpme #imuseless #megaunorganised
@easyJet partner left purse on flight Ezy2305. EASYJET Staff at the airport couldn't be bothered. Customer service line no use either

Holy actual shit . Aboard the 9.40 @easyJet Amsterdam to Edinburgh and it's ON TIME for once!
Once again @easyJet let us down with their inability to take off and land on time. Nearly 30 minutes late and we've missed the last train!

@easyJet #EZY865 delayed, poor ground handling at @Gatwick_Airport and EDI delays after 90 minutes.
@easyJet that's not the point Ruben! You only allow 1 bag but the handbag has to be inside! Man, even Ryanair has different rules!!!
Just 'read' (told) the kid a bedtime story over the phone. #delayedflight #noreasonsgiven #itsthelittlethingswemiss #edinburgh @easyjet

@easyJet yet again appalling service and incredibly rude staff at LTN. Appalled. Should always fly @Monarch
Merci @easyJet pour cette attente interminable de nos valises à #Nantes ! Scandaleux.
@easyJet wasn't blaming you guys in anyway. But clearly theses guys are bored of there job !!! #yourfiredihope
@easyJet can I bring a photo frame in my hand luggage?
@easyJet your site is fucking shit. tried adding luggage 3 times now and every time your site plays up
@easyJet we even paid more for an earlier flight but now this one will leave after the later one was meant to :) great :)
@OmahaILL @easyJet Hahaha. I bet.
always known easyjet planes were constantly delayed but a two hour delay is a joke @easyJet!! could've at least told us before we left

@easyJet  disappointed you knew there was a 15 min delay on the IOM - Liverpool you still out peiple@in hold for 45 minutes!

@easyJet hi there, 30 days until departure, have booked via travel republic, when can we check in/receive our documents ? Many thanks x
@easyJet Hi Ari, Unfortunately it appears that is only for a 3hr delay. Disappointing, there should be a caveat for time of day also.
@easyJet done! Thanks!

@easyJet It was hugely inconvenient, again. Too little too late. No more EasyJet - cannot rely on it anymore.
@easyJet we haven't taken the flight. We haven't and can't take the flight as it's been delayed by over 5 hours.
@easyJet 's incredible consistency never ceases to amaze me. 6 flights delayed in a row. #sleazyjet
@easyJet I am sure you'd say you care about your passengers' luggage. Let's see what your "investigation" says. Cannot wait!
.@easyJet suggest your gate staff @LGW get some customer service training; provide no info &amp; then get stroppy w passengers? Not acceptable
@easyJet and now half the passengers are drunk and swearing onboard #goodbyeeasyjet
@easyJet thanks.  Nt my wedding jst a bridesmaid helping the bride! Wat can we do if it won't fit cabin bag size? Dn't want it in hold obvs.

What an utterly dreadful experience with @easyJet at @ManchesterAirp. Incredibly rude staff.
@easyjet Is there any reason that the LTN-&gt;CPH route can’t be booked after the end of March. Please tell me it’s not cancelled! 😲
Cellos are full price seats but don't get hand luggage. How is that fair?  @easyJet bad service
@easyJet days or weeks?
We book 10 seats for easyjet, we're half way through the queue and don't get one piece of hand luggage on board. @easyJet bad service
@easyJet can someone advise just what is going into on with EZY211. Can't even estimate the delay correctly!
Enjoying the new look of @EDI_Airport terminal shopping. Normally only allowed #airside!! Nice to be a customer tod… https://t.co/7NAfxQE3hL
1 semaine qu'on ne peut pas effectuer de remboursement et personne ne répond au numéro service client France… https://t.co/qRVoq0LyKk
@easyJet ...less than helpful &amp; didn't seem interested, leaving us to fix things ourselves. 2/2
@easyJet Hey,
Will be a strike on the 19th on Sunday in Berlin airport?
Because I have the flight EZY1746 (to Toulouse)Thanks..

@easyJet Hi Rik, thank you for replying &amp; we made it home eventually. I think your staff at Schonefeld &amp; your customer services were 1/2...
@Gatwick_Airport please can you have the red carpet ready and sing happy birthday over the tannoy today when I land please @easyJet  @iom
Just arrived in Bordeaux. Wearing corporate colours for the flight @easyJet https://t.co/XcnNuYgXIJ
@easyJet surprise surprise flight delayed again.
@easyJet - problem at Bordeaux. Gate called 10 mins ago for 11.15am  lgw flight. Queue for passports /gates is 20 mins +
@easyJet Come fly with me, let's fly away. Oh maybe not. Very shoddy. https://t.co/mPWdFs4zjq #easyjet
@easyJet BRS-AMS on 22nd March just £35...bargain! Shame no cheap flights so flying back to LGW with @British_Airways the next day for £40
@easyJet My last 3 flights have been delayed, last time i could left from hotel, drove and been home before the flight arrived. Not good
@Vivienneclore @cakesmyth @GMB @selasigb @easyJet Oh of course he is! 😂😂
Tu fais quoi @easyJet avec ton vol EZS1416 ?! 50 min de retard !
Thanks to @easyJet for agreeing to pay any interest if I have to go into my overdraft this month after having to spend a lot unexpectedly!
@SurferVert @easyJet @AirFranceFR @Figaro_Economie tu vas ou ? Avec qui ?
Je prends toujours @easyJet sauf que je pars dimanche et pas pratique donc je choisis @AirFranceFR ...
TA DA !

@KozarH @transaviaFR Dommage que votre compagnie soit plus cher @easyJet même en prenant les billets 6 mois à l'avance! #Venise
Thanks @easyjet for finding our pram @ Copenhagen Airport &amp; delivering it to our hotel. Great service &amp; means we can explore the city now!
@easyJet quand on essaie de te forcer à mettre ton appareil photo en soute mais y'a plein de places en haut pour les bagages #finieasyjet
@easyJet but that isn't what happened. The flights were 4 months away and price jumped because the booking system is designed to deceive.
@cakesmyth @Janebbakes @GMB @selasigb @easyJet duh he is matching his tie to the gmb logo :)
Latest Con! Beware ppl, got charged £45 for taking an extra bumbag on board @easyJet flight 🤑😡💩
@easyJet when will the flights for December be released?

@easyJet I have tried to contact you re a claim for delayed flight and haven't had a reply. It's been more than 7 days per your email 😡!!
@selasigb @cakesmyth @GMB @easyJet 😂😂
@cakesmyth @Janebbakes @GMB @easyJet Friday job. Ladies and gents, listen to our on board safety announcement....
@cakesmyth @GMB @selasigb @easyJet 😂😂
@Janebbakes @GMB @selasigb  #powercouple didn't know Sels works for @easyJet with that tie 😂
@easyJet you must know that's not good enough. We were sent to the gate before the plane had even left England - that's not hard to explain
@easyJet so annoying everybody with handbag in hand luggage is fine, but will flying on time ever be an option? Faithful to lateness again.

@easyJet Why when you book on the UK site do you have to give a reason for travel, but on the German site you can select "Keine Angabe?"
Pathetic service @easyJet disgusted!!!. Would never ever fly again

@easyJet if you are dropping your bags the night before at Gatwick do all passengers need to be in attendance?
Shocking lack of signage for special assistance at @STN_Airport @easyJet. My friend, an amputee, has had to walk through crowds for 40+ mins
@easyJet 2404 from AGP on 15/03/17.  Your crew member Bertie - INCREDIBLY professional when dealing with a very rude passenger. He was FAB!
