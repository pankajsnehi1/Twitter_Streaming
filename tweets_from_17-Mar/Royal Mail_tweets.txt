@RoyalMail the tea is a gift; not for sale. One parcel is 500g; other 250g. Thank you!
Two things I hate. eBay selling and @RoyalMail. Two things can't go together to the same person, no. Must be split and pay double postage üò°
@RoyalMail ok, thank you. Was concerned cos do have redirection in place but to not from the address this was sent to.
@RoyalMail you know what, next time I'm going to let the dog out. See how fast he gets the message then.
Yet another parcel lost in the post. 5 parcels have gone missing since new year. Sort it out @RoyalMail !!
@RoyalMail is there a number to call above your escalation team? A head office or something getting sick of your company now! üò°üò°üò°
@RoyalMail it's been over 10 days that I've been expecting my delivery, the comments on the site have not changed since ordered.
@RoyalMail .... I may raise with police as it is not a normal 'delay' or 'lost' item but three all as same place.  Theft only explanation.
@RoyalMail ...security of submitted parcels at PO leaves lot to be desired. If u saw u could see how easy it is for someone to steal.....
@RoyalMail yes, that is correct. I'll go check again this afternoon
@RoyalMail I have spoken to customer service and there is a customs charge and they are arranging for a card to be resent with details
@RoyalMail Thnx.  I'm aware of procedure for lost parcel and I accept that. This is not one but three at same counter same day same sender.

@RoyalMail The service at my local sorting office is genuinely unacceptable. Do you have any interest in resolving it? Complained before.
@RoyalMail you e-mail me to say you've delivered my item to a neighbour but no card to indicate which one! This is going to be fun, thanks!

@RoyalMail Nothing missing but direct access to personal details! No apology bag either. This is how I found it: https://t.co/2DMVrYyJWU
@RoyalMail it fitted the large letter slot, I made them weigh it, and it came in under the large letter weight
@asid_b @RoyalMail at least you got some of your mail. We got nothing, apart from a headache and a lot of lost hours chasing their mistake!
@RoyalMail yes, I know. It was a large letter, paid for as a large letter, but not delivered and attempted charge for excess
@RoyalMail @RoyalMailStamps thanks- seems harsh for packages from charity but not your fault. Apologies
@RoyalMail Excellent customer service sorting out a claim I had for a missing parcel. Thank you, thank you!!!
