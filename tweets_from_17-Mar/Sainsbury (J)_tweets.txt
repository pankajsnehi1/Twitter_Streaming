@sainsburys Hi Cheryl, does the Sainsburys store have a record of the parcel being received? Still no luck contacting a real DPD person :(

The City page in @ExpressandStar today features @sainsburys, @ToyotaMotorCorp, @EurostarUK, @balfourbeatty and @bankofengland interest rates
Hi @DPD_UK, I need to find a parcel apparently delivered to @sainsburys, but no staff can find it. Can I speak to someone at DPD plz? thanks
@MallowandMarsh @sainsburys Never seen any in ours, must look harder I guess. :-/

@sainsburys Refurb'd Farnham store looks great but layout is v poor &amp; totally illogical. Seems like less choice as well. Overall not great!
@sainsburys I've just sent you a message.
@sainsburys Thank you.
We are now collecting @sainsburys Active Kids vouchers for new sports equipment! Please send all vouchers to reception.
@sainsburys and I've been constantly lied to about this! It was meant to have been done on the 7th! https://t.co/jXeK48nqd6
@sainsburys Good news! Thanks for the reply.
@sainsburys to do a long time ago, there's no way standing around and chatting would have been tolerated!
@sainsburys when I worked on sainsburys checkouts 15 years ago, if you had that much time to talk, the managers would have found you a job

@sainsburys I had to leave the till I was using to go and get someone to help him, and the assistant looked put out that I had interrupted
@sainsburys it's been 5 working days! Again! Will be taking it up with trading standards.
@sainsburys they are too busy chatting amongst themselves to notice when customers need help, an old man was waiting ages today for help
@sainsburys I've tweeted you about this quite a lot, but the staff in the Bromley store supervising self scan really need to do better

@sainsburys I don't need a refund. I just don't want all the carrots I ever buy turning into pulp as they do nowadays 'cos of over chilling.
@sainsburys last night. they have been gone 2 weeks 'theft of bags'..big queue, 4 staff on tills..no one using self serve. false economy!

@sainsburys in doing anything because you IGNORE your customers. Unless they way meat. Shelfs and shelfs of meat available. No veggie choice
Had to ask a @sainsburys counter server to wash their hands after they wiped hand over mouth then git me something from bakery. #SPEW
@sainsburys Nope. The only version removed is the vegetarian version. THATS discriminating. You've ignored ALL my product requests. No point
