@Welshbeard @Tesco Mind you, I like custard more than the pudding most times 😀
I heard a @Tesco radio advert encouraging women to hold a baby and stir-fry with their spare hand.  Hot oil, heat, frying pan, child #DANGER
@Welshbeard @Tesco Well it's described as 'finest' but it's short on dates, in my book.  But fair play, for a bought in pud, great stuff
Even #StPatricksDay hasn't stopped @Hobgoblin_beer from selling out at @Tesco tonight!
@BatstoneJC @Tesco How posh!
@Tesco unfortunately there's not any stores close to me!
