@SkyUK  sky store says i can pre order beauty and the beast but there is no release date?? When is the release date??
Already dissatisfied with @SkyUK  signed up over a week ago to broadband and still not connected.. and no promises gift card either üòí
The Netflix buffering screen is the perfect advertisement to change your Internet provider. Seriously thinking about leaving @SkyUK.
Sky Q is unreal, the things your can do are class. Top work from  @SkyUK #SkyQ
Got to love scammers from digital technology (02030049346) pretending to be @SkyUK @SkyHelpTeam &amp; trying to sell insurance on my hd box.
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK feeling your pain
Cant wait to leave @SkyUK in june, rip off merchants . Bad mistake not leaving last year .
Didn't realise that when I signed a contract with @SkyUK  8/9 yrs back I was doomed. Sky making the switch impossible. Help @SkyHelpTeam
@chipods @SkyUK indeed, lots seem to be leaving at moment. Sick of putting money into premier league players pockets!
@carlpeirson @SkyUK pretty much exactly the same mate, surely loyalty should get rewarded without the threat of cancellation!
@chipods @SkyUK yeah Lou rang to cancel, they said but you're a loyal customer so we can do it 1/2 your cost plus extra stuff ü§îüò°
@carlpeirson @SkyUK  ha ha ha, same here mate, mine has just been disconnected! Greedy sods! Been with them like forever! #üñïüèø
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK if u haven't already ask to speak to the Tech Team. We us same problem and they fixed it
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK Same here.
So we've had @SkyUK a month and it's already fucked up, not working ... but an engineer can't come out for 4 days? No TV for 4 days? üëçüèº
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK Are they fixing it4yooüò£?? Ours died recently even tho it had power light on. Had to get a replacement/engineer.ü§î
@SkyUK I want you to stop contacting me and completely close my acccount. Still getting junk mail when requested not to.
@virginmedia thanks I got them in the post and will be in touch soon. Have already cancelled @SkyUK
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK u see how silly tech is we need 2 go back 2 the old school such as cd singles plz guys keep cd singles alive thanks
Daniel @SkyUK is hilarious! Absolutely made my day. 10/10 on his customer service. Give that boy a pay rise üòÇ #customerserviceskills
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK üò± we've just upgraded to this and getting it in a few weeks.
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK Thats sky for you. Same thing happened to us a few weeks ago! x
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK it could be a fault in the box if you have had 2 reset or reconnect it maybe an idea to give them a call #nofoboff
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK tell sky you will want a refund Claire or you will go elsewhere üëåüòäxx
@_ClaireRichards @SkyUK what a nightmare x
@SkyUK hi can you please help me my viewing card coming up not authorised
Starting to really lose my patience with #skyQ @skyuk third time this morning having to reset or reconnect the box it's ridiculous x
@falconer_claire @SkyUK 
Hmmm.
Pity I cancelled my SKY subscription.  When Jerry Hall married Rupert I just couldn't bear it any more. S.
Bye Bye @SkyUK i'd like to say it's been a pleasure knowing you but it hasn't. Funny how you offered the world when we cancelled üò§

@lmasht @SkyUK literally goes off all the time mine üò© gets to about 9:00pm and just goes absolutely pants, pointless even having it üòÇ
@jakeashton1993 @SkyUK does yours go off every time a plane goes over like mine ? Does my head in !!!!
@SkyUK it would be extremely convenient if you were able to set programs to series record by pressing a button during the advert
The difference of profiting $5,000 and $270 for me today was having @SkyUK broadband, obviously, I got the latter.
@SkyUK sort your shit internet out
