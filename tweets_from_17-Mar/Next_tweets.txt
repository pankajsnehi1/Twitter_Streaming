@nextofficial what time do the Bromborough and Cheshire oaks stores open tomorrow?
Alarm set for super stupidly early o'clock ready for the @nextofficial sale and then the cinema for @beourguest #ExcitedAsHell
@nextofficial why take the front pockets from the black 360 jeans?! Comfiest jeans I ever had but their replacement now has no pockets!
@irvsbird @nextofficial thank you so much üòäüê∏
@emma_tabb @nextofficial  the invites are random. You usually need to have your account for a while, not owe too much,  regular payments etc
@vikspics its by @nextofficial  üòä
@luvlylouise @nextofficial I have a NextPay account also but never got any sort of invite?! Am I missing something here üòî
@nextofficial #nextsale very disappointing.  Had my eye on 3 items, now all out of stock despite the preview having so many sizes available.
Am I really setting my alarm for 5.30am on my day off AND giving up my lie in to go to the @nextofficial sale? Best find some bargains!
