@SSE hey there please can you dm me so I can get my account number for an online account
Just read that gas prices are going up by about 12%. Beennwith the same company for years. Time to shop around @phoenixni @SSE who's cheaper
Great advice @SSE. 11% increase in the bill and I can save 21 pence a year. #electricity #bills https://t.co/KdF4uVixgX
I'm sick of you guys writing to me about increasing prices. Can I not get some good news for once? @SSE @EE @Leicester_News @stwater
@SSE How greedy can you get?  Letter arrives putting prices up from 15.61p to 17.59p.  Looked elsewhere and I'm cha… https://t.co/kBMz0pCvbK
Are you serious @SSE ? 21% price rise in my electric?? And if change tariff I can save a whopping £0.44/year. Think I'll look elsewhere!
Aye well I must be above average then because my increase is 22% - oh to be average eh ? £300 a year extra, thanks… https://t.co/TI9kxO39U5
@SSE ouch. Time to do an energy comparison. Moral of the story, electric heating is crap. https://t.co/VYSfiZ0AZE

@SSE What has an orang-utan got to do with the UK or fossil fuel energy? 🙄
So @SSE you have works going on in SO40 2** area until 28/03. Will the noisy generator be left on every night until then?!!
@Odell68 @SSE  lack of support . Why should we call when you have been made aware ?
Ffs @SSE send this when I am sober https://t.co/BftYDnTL8F
@SSE  do you have a uk call centre number.  Struggling to understand the one ending 9696
I just switched to @IresaEnergy from @SSE and saved about 20%
...and that was before SSE announced another 15% hike!

My gas read out for the month come on @SSE sort it out eh.
Been weeks now https://t.co/kNV4ZSfgih
@SSE got a price increase so decided to call customer services to lock tariff and your phone system keeps hanging up on me.. 5 times now!
So @SSE has kindly informed me that my bill will go up by a whopping £158 a year. Time for a switch, methinks
Considering I'm meant to have 'superfast' broadband it really is 'superslow' 🙄🤔 @SSE
@SSE - https://t.co/ZvUnUe7Xh5

About bloody time!

@SSE just sent me my electricity estimate for next year. Up from £2,700 to £3,177 is a 17.6% increase. Are you having a fucking laugh!!!
To be clear, my annual bill won’t be £100. That’s £100 ON TOP OF my annual bill of over £400. Time to switch. @SSE
. @SSE You’re putting my electric up £100 per year, you lot lost your fucking minds? Here’s a mask and a gun for your other robberies. #fb

Big thanks to our main corporate supporters @clydesdalebank @SSE and @stagecoachgroup. Great to have you literally 'on-board'.
@SSE Can I DM you, please? Thanks.
What do you say to this ? @YourSSE @SSE #Gas #Electricity #Pricy https://t.co/J2ZITz17Qs
Very unwelcome letter from @SSE giving me the news that their electricity charges will increase by over 22% in April. Time to switch?
Letter from @SSE to say my electricity bill will go up by £95.20 this year. However, if I pay by DD, I could save 34p. #FirstClassPost
