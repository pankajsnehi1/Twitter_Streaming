@MakeItSoTStaffs @TaylorWimpey I wouldn't be. Not if they r leasehold. No need to sell leasehold homes. Even the prime minister agrees !!
@TaylorWimpey seriously r u asking leaseholders to comment on this ? Your aggravating everyone further.  Sort the mess out #leaseholdscandal
@TaylorWimpey this is ridiculous. People can't sleep at night because of Taylor Wimpey. Sort it out!!!!! #leaseholdscandal delay after delay
@TaylorWimpey Future homes for Leaseholders unable to afford soaring ground rents on Taylor Wimpey properties? #leaseholdscandal
@TaylorWimpey I'm not averse to laying down in front of a bulldozer, as long as I get 4 pints at lunchtime and have my towel!
@stocktoncouncil @TaylorWimpey this time can I have an answer from someone in authority - not just the minion who runs the Twitter account!
@stocktoncouncil @TaylorWimpey before you start saying anything about people in villages - the people in Billingham don't want them either!
@stocktoncouncil @TaylorWimpey Don't say you weren't warned!
@stocktoncouncil @TaylorWimpey You don't do core drills on farmland for no reason! BTW - just so you know, we don't want any houses there!
@stocktoncouncil @TaylorWimpey OK - it is about time one of you admitted WTF is going on with that land between Billingham and Wolviston!
@TaylorWimpey do your leasehold terms restrict "buyers" from adding them without the large cost involved with notifying the freeholder?

@TaylorWimpey @kimmyc23 and the next advert is this. I'm sure you could  offer advice to potential buyers?
@kimmyc23 @BluebellCrst @TaylorWimpey @BBCWatchdog this is very disturbing
@TaylorWimpey Does your guide discuss the charges freeholders will impose on building a conservatory?
@kimmyc23 @BluebellCrst @TaylorWimpey @BBCWatchdog they're a disgusting shambles. 20 months floors still crumbling
@TaylorWimpey can't possibly save for a conservatory when the cost to buy my freehold is very expensive #LeaseholdScandal
@TaylorWimpey dread to think how much the land lord would ask for to build on THEIR land #leaseholdscandal
@TaylorWimpey how about maximising profits at the expense of hard working people? #leaseholdscandal
