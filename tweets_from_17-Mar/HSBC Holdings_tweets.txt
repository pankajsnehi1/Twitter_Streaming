@HSBC having to physically go into a branch to prove identity for an original complaint ??? #darkages
Was planning to close my @HSBC premier account, now definitely planning to do so, as soon as I have some time for them to waste.
I call back as instructed, but @HSBC operator can't help me. Now on hold. I have better things to do than have my bank waste my time.
Stupid stupid stupid. When @HSBC calls to confirm a transaction, they have a caller ID of "119942". Super-spammy, of course I don't answer.
