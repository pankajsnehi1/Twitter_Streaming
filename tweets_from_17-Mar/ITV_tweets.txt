@ITV
@blog_artist @ITV @TheNightlyShow The show is bad.
Enjoying @ITV #LethalWeapon more than I thought I would. @ClayneCrawford and @DamonkWayans are just fab as Riggs and Murtaugh. Great show!

@ITVNightlyShow @ITV @radioleary put this show to rest and stop embarrassing the talent you employ on other shows
@ITV well I've given it another go and the nightly show is still a bit pants. News at ten again please!
To be clear, the reason why #NightlyShow is so rubbish is the substandard editing and tinny sound. Awful production values! @ITV
@ITVNightlyShow @ThisisDavina @MelanieCmusic @radioleary @ITV Great
@itv @TheNightlyShow It's the show that's really bad. It's a mess. It could be saved 🙏🏻👂🏻@andrewmckirdy
Where was @MelanieCmusic at the end of #thenightlyshow ? Pissed off she was only given 2 minutes ? Don't blame her @ITV #megastar #insulting
Great show coming up with @leahcharlesking tonight. See you at 00:50 live on @ITV.
@ITVNightlyShow @ITV @radioleary who care's.
@jclanoe @ITV Seriously, it's the worst ep yet. And that's saying something. I'll be giving O'Dreary a wide birth next week ..
@LethalWeaponHQ @mattmillerTV @LethalWeaponFOX @ITV Its now at number 17. Woohoo go #LethalWeapon
@itv #thenightlyshow  hope @radioleary doesn't stoop to vulgarity that Davina felt necessary to get laughs tonight. I'm sure he won't!
Are you serious? I missed tonight. Surely 10.15pm slots always sell. @TheTVGrump @ITV
@ITVNightlyShow @ThisisDavina @ITV Wish you were off
@ITV @ThisisDavina @radioleary @MelanieCmusic 💜💜💜

When they literally can't sell any advertising slots during #TheNightlyShow, and it's solely @ITV promos .. Stick a fork in it. It's done.
@Tjsam1000 @ITV thanks Tom

Just 26 mins to go until @ThisisDavina's last night as host kicks off! #TheNightlyShow @ITV
As an alternative to #thenightlyshow maybe @ITV should put The #TraceyUllmanShow  on 👍
@ITVNightlyShow @ThisisDavina @MelanieCmusic @radioleary @ITV oh no nor Dermot thought they were trying to save the show 😱😱😱😱😱
@JthanPrime @ITV they don't even know!!

@caspertheghost1 @ITV Yeah. Only one though, BBC better at the rest
WTF @ITV You've got the monopoly for broadcasting the #CheltenhamFestival and you stop broadcasting with 2 races still to go?  Useless.
@kreans @ITV really? I think it is awful. BBC let themselves down by having random women on it who have no clue about the game
@Free_2_Offend @AMDWaters @ITV I'm so behind. Was a hardcore Emmerdale &amp; Corrie fan. Then the channels here went digital &amp; no more free CBC.
@caspertheghost1 @ITV I think their rugby coverage is superior to the BBC's
Is there a sport @itv have ever covered well? Rugby, Football, racing, formula 1. All terrible
@DuncanBannatyne just saw you on @ITV celeb home secrets.. I absolutely love you're #BMW... Won't it so bad #stunning # quality

@ITV Why would you stop showing the racing with 2 left? Is there really a national clamouring for a half hour Duncan Bannatyne ego massage?
#NowPlaying 'Believe' by @MumfordAndSons @ITV #CheltenhamFestival closing montage @itvracing
Can't get enough of @AP_McCoy Could listen to him all day long @CheltenhamRaces @ITV #GoldCup 🏇🏿
The @ITV coverage of Cheltenham is interesting. It's like showing a stage from Le Tour and then cutting the coverage with 15km to go.
@JackSavoretti @ITV @ThisisDavina ...👍❤💙 x
@ITV @CheltenhamRaces ITV innovation = Same faces but different button on my remote #ITVRacing
@joefattorini did the wine show stop unexpectedly on @ITV Friday's? Cos I was loving it? Where it gone???
Not a horse racing fan as such but must say coverage on @ITV is excellent as is @AP_McCoy punditry. Great television. #happypunter
"It really is a monkey this horse" Irish commentator on @ITV at @CheltenhamRaces
@ITV @itvracing coverage of #CheltenhamFestival has been immense. Professional, laughter and entertainment. Well done to team. Ed is class.
@Lauratobin1 @GMB @ITV @itvracing it's  gorgeous absolutely amazing gold cup good luck 🙂👌
@iNSiG9FiX @ITV Yeah, but then NOBODY would watch horsebackriding while waiting for something else...
Dear @itv please create a 290th channel dedicated to horseback riding. That way regular ppl can still watch regular tv 😊
@ITV can we have the news back on at 10pm? And scrap the nightly show? It's just it's all a bit pants!!! Cheers
@allantanddec @ITV HOPE THIS TERRIBLE SERIES THE NIGHTLY SHOW ENDS SOON AND WE GET NEWS AT TEN BACK AT 10pm ASAP.!!

@ShitelyNo @ITV @ThisisDavina just can the whole show it's horrible stop putting people trough the pain
@paparazi75 @itvfootball @ITV @GlennHoddle @markpougatch it goes with managing a successful club @paparazi75. Its why they build big squads.
@itvfootball @ITV @itvhub @GlennHoddle @markpougatch What does Jose suggest?. Go out of every cup competition early so fewer games.

@itvjeremykyle @EastEnglandAmb @ITV I thought this piece was poor. JK's interview with the publican was aggressive &amp; inappropriate. Poor.
